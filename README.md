<h1 align="center"> 🏁🎬 Introduction 🎬🏁  </h1>

- In this repository **"Fz3r0 - 802.11 Wi-Fi Knowledge Base"**, I compile information from various reliable sources, previously curated and studied by myself prior to inclusion, delving into aspects of **IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks Technology**, better known as **Wi-Fi**.

- Originally conceived to centralize my own study materials for certifications such as **CWNP (CWNA, CWAP, CWDP, CWSP, CWISA) Offensive Security (PEN-210, OSWP), Ruckus / Commscope (RCWA), Cisco (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE Enterprise Wireless, ENWLSD, ENWLSI)** this repository has evolved into a highly comprehensive index, serving as a centralized resource and cheatsheet containing all information, from the essential to the advanced, for a wireless engineer.

- The purpose of this repository is to gather comprehensive knowledge covering all aspects of the IEEE 802.11 standard (Wi-Fi), from basic fundamentals to advanced topics, encompassing from the origins, history and basic knowledge of wireless networks to the most advanced technical analysis, design, security, standards, best practices and configurations/deployments of the latest wireless devices in the todays market for entrerprise and high density networks.

- This repository primarily aggregates **publicly available and freely accessible sources of information from Internet**, enabling anyone to study them. However, in exceptional cases, links of **paid resources are included** to ensure comprehensive coverage of information if needed. The resources include **research papers, study materials, repositories, books, technical examples, vendor documentation, tutorials, videos, guides, diagrams, tables, cheatsheets, codes and scripts, labs, and more.**
  
- Some of the shared resources are created by myself and are hosted within the repository including: scripts, source codes, packet captures, labs, summaries, diagrams, tables, configuration files, lists, etc.

- Some resources included in this repository are not only and strictly information about IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), due to the nature of the Technology and the compatibility with other kind of Networks and Devices, some resources includes information about other branches of Information & Communitacion Technologies (ICTs) & Networking. 

- The majority of shared resources are in English; however, some are in Spanish, as it is my native language, and I have found very comprehensive resources with excellent information in Spanish. Nonetheless, I endeavor to share resources in English to make it a more universal language.

- This repository may contain techniques, configurations, codes or scripts that could harm some systems and devices or not comply with some regulations of all Countries. Read carefully each file documentation before download, extract, deploy, configure, execute, copy, compile. Be sure that you understand and are complying with the laws regarding Wireless and Radio Regulations, Informatics, Sensitive Data & other kind of ICTs regulations in your area. It is recommended to study the legislation of the Regulatory Domain in each Country before replicating any process included in this repository.

I'm just a very lucky person who was born surrounded by IBM computers and walls full of floppy disks back in the 80's.

Today I'm a Level 3 NOC Engineer specialized on high-level troubleshooting, analytics, security, support and network performance design & optimization focusing in 802.3 Ethernet Networks & 802.11 Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi). I have experience with vendors such as: Cisco, Zyxel, Ruckus, Fortinet, SonicWall, MikrotTik, Aruba, Starlink, Huawei, Microsoft, Linux, among others... but also I have some years of background experience with other IT branches like programming, scripting, data base administration, pentesting, ethical hacking and data analytics.

My day-to-day tasks are Multi-Layer Packet & Frame Exchange analysis for a wide range of 802.3 Ethernet & 802.11 WiFi Protocols, Hex modification, Reverse Engineering, Packet Tampering & Injection. Proficient in tools like Wireshark, TCP Dump, Scappy, NMap, Python, HEX Editors, iPerf, etc. Experience with Network Security, Layer 2 & Wireless Pentesting; Defensive Security SIEM, IDS/IPS, DLP & AV... and some CTF in my spare time!

I also configure & design the architecture for network devices including 802.11 Wireless Infraestructure, Next-Generation Firewalls, Routing, Switching and Different types of Services for high-density network environments, within verticals such as International Airports, Hospitality, Health, Retail, Entretainment, Education, Government, Public Transportation, as well as remote locations with Satellite-Only Connections.

## ⭕📖 Definition: `Wi-Fi`
_Wi-Fi is not an abbreviation for “wireless fidelity”; the name was created by "Interbrand", a marketing firm hired by WECA & chosen because it sounds more pleaseant than "IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence" & similarity to “hi-fi” (high-fidelity). The name is often written as WiFi, Wifi, or wifi, but these are not approved by the Wi-Fi Alliance._

- [Wi-Fi :: Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) _`english`_

## ⭕📖 Definition: `IEEE 802.11`
_IEEE 802.11 is the same as Wi-Fi... IEEE 802.11 refers to the set of standards that define communication for wireless LANs (wireless local area networks, or WLANs). The technology behind 802.11 is branded to consumers as Wi-Fi. This means, for the "end user" it's easier to remember the word "Wi-Fi" instead of "IEEE 802.11b/a/g/n/ac/ax/be Standard for Wireless Communications" or something like "IEEE 802.11b - DSSS/Direct Sequence"._

# 🌎♻️🧙‍♂️ Internetworking: `The Internet Ecosystem`
_The Internet is successful in large part due to its unique model: shared global ownership, open standards development, and freely accessible processes for technology and policy development. The Internet has enjoyed unprecedented success thanks to its open, transparent, and collaborative model. The model relies on processes that are local, bottom-up and accessible to users around the world. | The Internet is a collection of autonomous and interconnected networks that implement open protocols and standards. No person, government, or entity owns or controls the Internet. Instead, a volunteer organization called ISOC (Internet Society) controls the future of the Internet. It appoints a technical advisory group called the IAB (Internet Architecture Board) to evaluate and set standards. | Input on protocols and standards can come from anybody-individuals, research groups, companies, and universities. A specification is submitted as an Internet draft and made available for review and comments. The Internet organizations evaluate whether these specifications should be advanced through a process that elevates the specification to different levels of maturity until it potentially reaches a standards status. The process is described under "Internet Standards."_

## IEEE Standards
_Each year, the IEEE SA conducts over 200 standards ballots, a process by which proposed standards are voted upon for technical reliability and soundness. In 2020, IEEE had over 1,200 active standards, with over 650 standards under development. | One of the more notable are the **IEEE 802 LAN/MAN group of standards**, with the widely used computer networking standards for both **wired** (**Ethernet, aka IEEE 802.3**) and **wireless** (**IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16**) networks, IEEE 1547 Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems, and ISO/IEEE 11073 Standards for Health Informatics._

## 📡⚙️🧬 `802.11` / `Wi-Fi Prime` / `DSS`
_The first wireless LAN (WLAN) standard was created by the IEEE committee in 1997 and was called 802.11. However, the 802.11 standard supported only up to 2 Mbps of bandwidth and quickly became obsolete. Subsequently, the IEEE created the 802.11a and 802.11b standards. IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode or Prime) – or more correctly IEEE 802.11-1997 or IEEE 802.11-1999 – refers to the original version of the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard released in 1997 and clarified in 1999. Most of the protocols described by this early version are rarely used today. The speed of 2 Mbps was insufficient for many applications, leading to the development of 802.11b._

### ⚙️🚀 **802.11 Prime** | **Wi-Fi 0** | **DSSS**: `Enhancements`

- **First 802.11 Wi-Fi PHY:** <br> <br>
    - **`CSMA/CA (Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance)`**: Originally defined carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance, this is a protocol for carrier transmission in 802.11 networks. It was developed to minimize the potential of a collision occurring when two or more stations send their signals over a data link layer. <br> <br>
    - **`2.4 GHz band`**: First 802.11 wireless standard that uses 2.4 GHz band. Three non-overlapping channels in industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) frequency band at 2.4 GHz.    

## 📡⚙️🧬 `802.11b` / `Wi-Fi 0` / `HR-DSSS`
_The DSSS version of legacy 802.11 Prime was rapidly supplemented (and popularized) by the 802.11b amendment in 1999, which increased the bit rate to 11 Mbps. Widespread adoption of 802.11 networks only occurred after the release of 802.11b, which resulted in multiple interoperable products becoming available from multiple vendors. Consequently, comparatively few networks were implemented on the 802.11-1997 standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in mid-1999 since 802.11b is a direct extension of the DSSS (Direct-sequence spread spectrum) modulation technique defined in the original standard. The Apple iBook was the first mainstream computer sold with optional 802.11b networking. Technically, the 802.11b standard uses complementary code keying (CCK) as its modulation technique, which uses a specific set of length 8 complementary codes that was originally designed for OFDM but was also suitable for use in 802.11b because of its low autocorrelation properties. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard released in 1997) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology as well as to the formation of the Wi-Fi Alliance. 802.11b devices suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4 GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, and cordless telephones. Interference issues and user density problems within the 2.4 GHz band have become a major concern and frustration for users. The adoption of 802.11b was crucial in popularizing wireless networks due to its higher speed and lower cost._

### ⚙️🚀 **802.11b** | **Wi-Fi 1** | **HR-DSSS**: `Enhancements` 

- **Direct extension of original 802.11 Prime (1997)** <br> <br>
    - **`More Data Rates available`**: Data rates with varying modulation types: 1, 2, 5.5 and up to 11 Mbps using Adaptative Rate Selection _(AKA Dynamic Rate Selection, Automatic Rate Selection, Dynamic Rate Shifting or Adaptive Rate Selection)_ <br> <br>

It can operate at 11 Mbit/s, but scale back to 5.5, then to 2, then to 1 Mbit/s in order to decrease the rate of re-broadcasts that result from errors.
  
## 📡⚙️🧬 `802.11a` / `Wi-Fi 2` / `OFDM`
_IEEE802.11a is the first wireless standard to employ packet based OFDM: Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing | Using the 5 GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage, since the 2.4 GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded. Degradation caused by such conflicts can cause frequent dropped connections and degradation of service | The effective overall range of 802.11a is slightly less than that of 802.11b/g; 802.11a signals cannot penetrate as far as those for 802.11b because they are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path and because the path loss in signal strength is proportional to the square of the signal frequency | he increased number of usable channels (4 to 8 times as many in FCC countries) and the near absence of other interfering systems (microwave ovens, cordless phones, baby monitors) give 802.11a significant aggregate bandwidth and reliability advantages over 802.11b/g. | 802.11a offered less interference from other devices but initially had lower adoption due to higher costs and shorter range._

### ⚙️🚀 **802.11a** | **Wi-Fi 2** | **OFDM**: `Enhancements` 

- **`5 GHz band`**: First 802.11 wireless standard that uses 5 GHz band. 12 non-overlapping unlicensed national information infrastructure (UNII) channels in 5 GHz frequency band. <br> <br>
- **`OFDM`**: First 802.11 wireless standard to employ packet-based OFDM (Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) with 52 subcarrier channels (using the 5 GHz band). Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex, OFDM, is a form of signal format that uses a large number of closely spaced carriers that are each modulated with a low rate data stream. The closely spaced signals would normally be expected to interfere with each other, but by making the signals orthogonal to each other, there is no mutual interference. The data to be transmitted is shared across all the carriers, providing resilience against selective fading from multi-path effects. <br> <br>
- **`More Data Rates available`**: Data rates with varying modulation types: 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and up to 54 Mbps using Adaptative Rate Selection 

## 📡⚙️🧬 `802.11g` / `Wi-Fi 3` / `ERP`
_IEEE 802.11g-2003, commonly known as 802.11g, represents an augmentation to the IEEE 802.11 protocol, functioning within the 2.4 GHz microwave band. This amendment ensures full backward compatibility with 802.11b; however, simultaneous operation of both methods incurs a substantial performance penalty. Serving as an extension of the 802.11b standard, 802.11g operates within the 2.4 GHz band, yet distinguishes itself by offering higher data rates, rendering it apt for multimedia applications. Leveraging the identical 20 MHz bandwidth as 802.11b, which yields 11 Mbit/s, 802.11g's Enhanced Rate PHY (ERP) now boasts data rates of up to 54 Mbps, same as 802.11a, but using 2.4 GHz (802.11a uses 5 GHz). This standard adopts Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for modulation, the same as 802.11a. 802.11g retains backward compatibility with 802.11b, enabling seamless integration of devices from both standards into a unified network infrastructure._

### ⚙️🚀 802.11n / Wi-Fi 4 / HT: `Enhancements` 
    
- 802.11n Backward compatibility switching :: Backward compatibility for devices in a net using earlier versions of Wi-Fi, this adds a significant overhead to any exchanges, thereby reducing the data transfer capacity. To provide the maximum data transfer speeds when all devices in the wireless local area network are operating on the 802.11n standard, the backwards compatibility feature can be removed. <br><br>
        - Legacy (only 802.11 a, b, and g)
        - Mixed (both 802.11 a, b, g, and n)
        - Greenfield (only 802.11 n) - maximum performance <br><br>
    
- 40 MHz Bandwith (Channel Bonding): First 802.11 Standard that uses more than only 20 MHz bandwith (using channel bonding technique) in both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands, recommendation for channel bonding for 40 MHz is only using it for the 5 GHz because there are a limited number of non-overlapping channels available in the 2.4 GHz band.

- MIMO with OFDM: In order to be able to carry very high data rates on the wireless LAN, often within an office or domestic environment, 802.11n has utilised MIMO. This gives the maximum use of the available bandwidth. | MIMO is a form of antenna technology that uses multiple antennas to enable signals travelling via different paths as a result of reflections, etc., to be separated and their capability used to improve the data throughput and / or the signal to noise ratio, thereby improving system performance.
    
- Spatial Streams / Multiplexing (up to 3x3): Wi-Fi Spatial streaming or multiplexing (often shortened to SM or SMX) is a transmission technique used in MIMO wireless communication to transmit independent and separately coded data signals, so called streams, from each of the multiple transmit antennas. This results in the space being reused, or multiplexed, more than one time. On each band, the Wireless-N standard is available in three primary configs, depending on the number of spatial streams being used. The lowest, single stream (1x1), dual stream (2x2) and three-stream (3x3), offering cap speeds of 150Mbps, 300Mbps and 450Mbps.

- Frame Aggregation: Frame aggregation is a feature that allows communicating on a shared link or channel, typically a TDM shared channel, with a minimum time slot that for efficiency reasons benefits from filling the time slot with data, i.e. sending two or more data frames in a single transmission. The feature is an important part of the IEEE 802.11e, 802.11n and 802.11ac wireless LAN standards that increases throughput with frame aggregation. | MAC service data unit (MSDU) aggregation relies on the fact that most mobile access points and most mobile client protocol stacks use Ethernet as their "native" frame format. It collects Ethernet frames to be transmitted to one or multiple destinations and wraps them in a single 802.11n frame. This is efficient because Ethernet headers are much shorter than 802.11 headers. | Frame aggregation is a process of packing multiple MSDUs or MPDUs together to reduce the overheads and average them over multiple frames, thereby increasing the user level data rate. A-MPDU aggregation requires the use of block acknowledgement or BlockAck, which was introduced in 802.11e and has been optimized in 802.11n.

- Transmit BeamFormig: Transmit Beamforming is a technique used to enhance the signal strength and quality in wireless communications. It involves adjusting the phase and amplitude of the signals transmitted from multiple antennas to focus the signal energy towards the intended receiver. This helps improve the signal-to-noise ratio and extend the coverage range of the wireless network.

- Training Fields (MAC Operations): PLCP Header & PHY Training - Training fields are essential components of the MAC (Media Access Control) layer operations in 802.11n. The PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) Header contains signaling information required for frame synchronization and modulation/demodulation. PHY (Physical Layer) Training involves the exchange of training sequences between the transmitter and receiver to estimate channel characteristics and optimize data transmission. These training fields enable efficient communication and enhance the reliability of wireless connections.

- Guard Interval: The guard interval is a period of time used in wireless communications to avoid interference between consecutive transmitted symbols. In the 802.11n standard, a guard interval of 800 nanoseconds (short GI) and 400 nanoseconds (long GI) was introduced, determining the waiting time between symbols to mitigate the effects of time dispersion and enhance interference resilience. This adjustment contributes to improving the efficiency and quality of data transmission in wireless environments. 

- HT Control in MAC Header: 

- 802.11n power saving: One of the problems with using MIMO is that it increases the power of the hardware circuitry. More transmitters and receivers need to be supported and this entails the use of more current. | Data is normally transmitted in a "bursty" fashion. This means that there are long periods when the system remains idle or running at a very slow speed. During these periods when MIMO is not required, the circuitry can be held inactive so that it does not consume power.

## 📡⚙️🧬 `802.11ac` / `Wi-Fi 5` / `VHT`
_IEEE 802.11ac-2013 or 802.11ac provides high-throughput wireless local area networks (WLANs) on the 5 GHz band. The standard has been retroactively labelled as Wi-Fi 5 by Wi-Fi Alliance. The specification has multi-station throughput of at least 1.1 gigabit per second (1.1 Gbit/s) and single-link throughput of at least 500 megabits per second (0.5 Gbit/s). This is accomplished by extending the air-interface concepts embraced by 802.11n: wider RF bandwidth (up to 160 MHz), more MIMO spatial streams (up to eight), downlink multi-user MIMO (up to four clients), and high-density modulation (up to 256-QAM). | The Wi-Fi Alliance separated the introduction of 802.11ac wireless products into two phases ("waves"), named "Wave 1" and "Wave 2". From mid-2013, the alliance started certifying Wave 1 802.11ac products shipped by manufacturers, based on the IEEE 802.11ac Draft 3.0 (the IEEE standard was not finalized until later that year). Subsequently in 2016, Wi-Fi Alliance introduced the Wave 2 certification, which includes additional features like MU-MIMO (down-link only), 160 MHz channel width support, support for more 5 GHz channels, and four spatial streams (with four antennas; compared to three in Wave 1 and 802.11n, and eight in IEEE's 802.11ax specification). It meant Wave 2 products would have higher bandwidth and capacity than Wave 1 products. | Wave 2, referring to products introduced in 2016, offers a higher throughput than legacy Wave 1 products, those introduced starting in 2013. The maximum physical layer theoretical rate for Wave 1 is 1.3 Gbit/s, while Wave 2 can reach 2.34 Gbit/s. Wave 2 can therefore achieve 1 Gbit/s even if the real world throughput turns out to be only 50% of the theoretical rate. Wave 2 also supports a higher number of connected devices._

### ⚙️🚀 802.11ac / Wi-Fi 5 / VHT: `Enhancements` 

- Extended channel binding: Optional 160 MHz and mandatory 80 MHz channel bandwidth for stations; cf. 40 MHz maximum in 802.11n.

- More MIMO spatial streams: Support for up to eight spatial streams (vs. four in 802.11n) 

- Downlink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO): Allows up to four simultaneous downlink MU-MIMO clients.  Multiple STAs, each with one or more antennas, transmit or receive independent data streams simultaneously.
    - Space-division multiple access (SDMA): streams not separated by frequency, but instead resolved spatially, analogous to 11n-style MIMO.
    - Downlink MU-MIMO (one transmitting device, multiple receiving devices) included as an optional mode.  
    - Multi-User MIMO allows for multiple client STA’s to communicate with an access point simultaneously. This technology uses different spatial streams on the same RF channel to allow for the simultaneous sessions.
        
- Transmit Beamforming: In order for MU-MIMO to function the access point must support transmit beamforming. Ideally the access point will be capable of 4X4:4 MIMO. This will allow multiple client STA’s to share the medium and communicate with an access point simultaneously. Keep in mind the sessions between the client devices and the access point are still one-to-one but the technology allows for multiple simultaneous sessions to occur.
    - Transmit beamforming used in 802.11ac technology allows for a non-AP STA (client device to take the role of a beamformee. The transmit beamforming feedback mechanism is included in the VHT null data packet (NDP) Announcement frame and includes more than one STA Info field. 

- 256-QAM (MCS 8/9 (256-QAM)): rate 3/4 and 5/6, added as optional modes (vs. 64-QAM, rate 5/6 maximum in 802.11n).

- 1024-QAM: Some vendors offer a non-standard 1024-QAM mode, providing 25% higher data rate compared to 256-QAM

- Standarized Beamforming: Beamforming with standardized sounding and feedback for compatibility between vendors (non-standard in 802.11n made it hard for beamforming to work effectively between different vendor products)

- Bandwith Coexistence: Coexistence mechanisms for 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz channels, 11ac and 11a/n devices

- MAC modifications: Mostly to support above changes

- 160 MHz channel bandwidths (contiguous 80+80):

- 80+80 MHz channel bonding (discontiguous 80+80):

- New PPDU HT Elements: Adds four new fields to the PPDU header identifying the frame as a very high throughput (VHT) frame as opposed to 802.11n's high throughput (HT) or earlier. The first three fields in the header are readable by legacy devices to allow coexistence
DFS was mandated between channels 52 and 144 for 5 GHz to reduce interference with weather stations using the same frequency band.

- More Channels: Channel 144 is in use, before 802.11ac this channel was unused.

### 802.11ax: OFDMA
_OFDMA implements the resource unit (RU)  Modulation methods include BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, 256-QAM, and 1024-QAM | The High Efficiency (HE) PHY is defined in the 802.11ax-2020 amendment. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a new modulation scheme introduced to the 802.11 standard with the 802.11ax amendment. OFDMA has been used in other networks and brings useful new features to the 802.11 WLAN. The most exciting feature is what you might call sub-channelization. It is the ability to divide the channel into multiple resource units (sub-channels) that can be used to transmit or receive to or from multiple STAs concurrently. All previous modulations and modulation schemes used the entire channel to communicate between STAs. This behavior was even true for multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO)._

- OFDM VS OFDMA

### `1024-QAM`
_1024-QAM modulation is also introduced with 802.11ax. 802.11ac supported 256-QAM, and these higher modulation rates increase the number of bits that can be represented in a symbol, effectively increasing the data rate. However, 1024-QAM will require excellent signal-to-noise ratio to function and will only work within short distances. The image below shows the constellations for 256-QAM and 1024-QAM. You can see why a better signal is required as the modulation rates go higher. The target becomes smaller and smaller, and the receiver must be able to process the received signal in a low noise environment to perceive the appropriate target._

### Uplink multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO): 
_Uplink MU-MIMO is added to the standard with 802.11ax as well. 802.11ac introduced downlink-only MU-MIMO, which was not very advantageous in production networks. Time will tell what impact uplink MU-MIMO will have, but it is available as of the 802.11ax amendment._



### `Target Wake Time (TWT)` 
_Target Wake Time (TWT) is a new power save scheduling ability for 802.11ax, OFDMA-only STAs. The clients request a sleep schedule from the AP, and they can then wake when required based on the schedule; this way, they do not have to wake at predefined intervals individually assigned to each STA. TWT was first introduced in 802.11ah but is more likely to see wide use with the ratification of 802.11ax._

### `BSS Coloring`
_To allow it to acknowledge communications of varied signal strengths, 802.11ax implements BSS coloring. Each BSS is assigned a color (identifying bits in the PHY layer communications), and BSS transmissions matching the current STA’s BSS color are considered active transmissions at a weaker signal level than those that do not match the current STA’s BSS color. Clearly stated, when a signal is received with the same BSS color as the receiving STA, a lower signal strength threshold is used to defer to the signal and remain silent. When a signal is received with a different BSS color than the receiving STA, a higher signal strength threshold is used to defer to the signal and remain silent. For example, the matching BSS color threshold could be -90 dBm and the non-matching BSS color threshold could be -75 dBm. The actual signal thresholds may be configurable in enterprise systems, and the exact method used at higher layers to process this data is not defined in the 802.11 standard but is instead left to the vendors to control._

### `Dual Band 2.4 Ghz & 5 GHz`
_802.11ax operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, unlike 802.11ac, which was 5 GHz-only. This dual-band allowance brings the efficiency gains of 802.11ax into the 2.4 GHz band, which is very congested and will eventually benefit from these gains. The benefit will be eventual because the clients and APs must support 802.11ax to achieve any of the benefits referenced in this section._

## 🏘️📡🖧 `DSS (Distribution System Service)`
_Distribution System Service (DSS) according to IEEE 802.11 is a functionality that allows the interconnection of several WLAN networks, thus creating a larger and more efficient network. This service allows several workstations to connect to the same network, regardless of their physical location. The DSS service is used in business and public environments, such as airports, shopping malls, and train stations. It allows a fluid and uninterrupted connection to users who move from one coverage area to another. The DSS service provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure, allowing companies and organizations to adapt to the changing needs of their users. Additionally, the DSS service is compatible with a wide range of devices, making it easy to deploy and maintain._

## 🖧⚖️⚙️ Network Planes: `Control`, `Data`, `Management`
_**Control, Management, and Data Planes are conceptual planes that include different types of communications. The control plane is about network control protocols like routing protocols and switching protocols. In WLANs it includes things like radio resource management (RRM) and adaptive radio management (ARM). The management plane is focused on managing the devices and monitoring them, such as WLAN configuration and monitoring. The data plan is focused on user data transfer. The users care about the data plane, but the control and management planes allow the network administrators to ensure that the users get the performance they require out of the data plane.** Consider RRM as an example and how it relates to the different planes. In the control plane, radio resource management (RRM) operates. In the management plane, radio resource management (RRM) is configured. In the user plane, data is sent on a WLAN that uses radio resource management (RRM) for radio configuration management. In the end, that which occurs in the control and management planes impacts the data plane functionality and performance._

### ⚙️🖧🥪 Network Planes: `Management Plane`
_The management plane is defined by administrative network management, administration and monitoring.  Here we would have a network-management solution used to monitor network devices.  Within 802.11 the functions of the management plane are: WLAN Configuration, WLAN Monitoring and Reporting, WLAN Firmware Management._

- This operation set addresses network configuration, monitoring, and administration.    In the early days of autonomous APs, management was performed uniquely on an AP-by-AP basis, and this was a major scalability drawback.  Initially, WLANs did not have a shared management plane, which meant that admins had to login to and manage each device independently.  The Wireless Network Management System (WNMS) came into play for management and monitoring of autonomous APs and were mostly usurped when WLAN controllers were introduced.  WLAN controllers were ushered in to centralize network management as well as to take on other roles that are part of the control and data planes.  At some point, multiple WLAN controllers become unwieldy, so a management solution is needed for them as well.  The WNMS comes back into play for that purpose.  Some devices exist solely to perform management functions.  Example functions of the management plane include firmware upgrades, device configuration, and network and status reporting and monitoring. <br> <br>
    - **`Example`**: APs configured and managed from the WLC, for example: SSIDs configuration (name, security, min data rates, bandwith control, max clients per AP, etc) 

---

### 🎮🖧🥪 Network Planes: `Control Plane`
_The control plane consists of control or signaling information and is often defined as network intelligence or protocols.  An example would be CAM tables and STP used by L2 switches for data forwarding.  Within 802.11 we have the following examples: | Adapative RF or RRM: Where coordinated channel and power settings for multiple APs are provided. |  Roaming Mechanisms:  This provides support for roaming handoffs between APs. | Client and Load Balancing:  Client load and performance metrics are collected and shared between APs to improve the WLAN experience | Mesh Protocols:  WLAN vendors use either L2 or L3 routing protocols to move user data between mesh APs._

- This plane includes the “control” functions related to effective cooperation and interaction between devices within a network.  Similar to the management functions, early networks with autonomous APs didn’t share a control plane.  They shared an Ethernet network for connectivity, but the APs did not communicate with each other to coordinate network control operations.  WLAN ‘control’lers are now the de facto solution to address the needs of the control plane, where many of these operations are centralized into one device (a controller) that communicates with all of the APs.  Again, similar to the management plane, multiple controllers pose new challenges, because controllers need a protocol for communications between one another.  In any case, graceful control of a WLAN is necessary for scalability of any kind.  Example functions include RRM (channel and power settings for automated networks) coordination, mobility management (such as fast secure roaming and uninterrupted policy and security management during transitions), and load balancing.  These operations are usually performed within a WLAN controller, though protocols may be used between APs to perform the same. <br> <br>
    - **`Example`**: Adaptive RF, load balancing, band balancing, roaming handoff, AP neighbor report, rogue AP report and other mechanisms exist on the WLC 

---
  
### 💾🖧🥪 Network Planes: `Data Plane`
_Also known as the user plane, the data plane is where the user traffic is actually forwarded in a network.  An example is an individual router where IP packets are forwarded.  The two wireless devices that typically participate here are the AP and the WLC._

- This plane includes the handling of data within a network.  The two devices that usually participate in the data plane are the AP and the WLAN controller.  Autonomous APs obviously handle all data forwarding operations locally, but controller-based APs may have some variation of data handling.  Centralized data forwarding, where all data is forwarded from the AP to the WLAN controller for processing, may be used in many cases, especially when the WLAN controller manages encryption/decryption or applies security policies.  Distributed forwarding, where the AP performs data forwarding locally, may be used in situations where it is advantageous to perform forwarding at the edge and to avoid a central location in the network for all data, which may require significant Ethernet capacity.  As with the management and control planes, each vendor has a unique method for handling data forwarding, with pros and cons for each.  Other functions that are a part of the data plane are VLAN tagging, QoS classification and queuing, and policy enforcement. <br> <br>
    - **`Example`**: Data traffic from/to client STA <==> AP <==> WLC // The WLC exists as a data distribution point for user traffic. APs tunnel all user traffic to the controller.

# 🫅🌎🖧 Networking Models: `OSI (ISO/IEC)`, `TCP/IP` & more
_Networking models, such as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) models, are conceptual frameworks that establish standards for communication between devices in a computer network. |The OSI model, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), is a seven-layer model that provides a structured approach to network design and communication. These seven layers include the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer. Each layer has specific functions, and together they define how data is transmitted, received, and processed across a network. | On the other hand, the TCP/IP model, developed by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), is a four-layer model (sometimes five layers) that is widely used as the standard for Internet communication. The TCP/IP model consists of the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and network access layer, and sometimes includes the data link layer as well. While both models serve the same purpose of facilitating communication between devices on a network, they have different structures and approaches. The OSI model provides a more theoretical framework, dividing communication into seven distinct layers, while the TCP/IP model is more practical and closely aligned with the implementation of the Internet. **Despite these differences, both models define how devices communicate, the functions performed at each stage of communication, and how information is organized during the process.**_

# 💀🎩🫅Fz3r0 Extended OSI Model for 802.11 Deep Analysis
_In Wireless 802.11 networks, Layers 1 and 2 are the most crucial, Layers 3 and 4 also play significant roles but are not part of the wireless technology. Higher layers, however, are sometimes less relevant as they extend beyond the core functions of 802.11. To fully grasp Layers 1 and 2, it's essential to break them down into sub-layers, identifying each one's Protocol Data Unit (PDU) and its interactions with higher or lower layers._

### 💊🖼️📦 Encapsulation: `SDU` & `PDU`
_Key Concept: The message used to communicate information for a particular protocol is called its protocol data unit (PDU) in OSI model terminology. That PDU is passed down to the next lower layer for transmission; since that layer is providing the service of handling that PDU, it is called the lower layer’s service data unit (SDU). The SDU is encapsulated into that layer’s own PDU and in turn sent to the next lower layer in the stack, proceeding until the physical layer is reached. The process is reversed on the recipient device._ 

Key Concept: **A layer N PDU is a layer N-1 SDU, which is encapsulated into a layer N-1 PDU.** <br><br>

- **`Example`**: The LPDU is generated at the LLC Sub-Layer (Layer 2 - Upper), and then is passed down into the MAC Sub-Layer (Layer 2 - Lower), the MAC Sub-Layer recieves it as a MSDU. So, the MAC layer process the MSDU, put a MAC-Header + FCS and that's called a MPDU (that is generated at the MAC Sub-Layer) and then is passed down into the PLCP Sub-Layer (Layer 1 - Upper), the PLCP Sub-Layer recieves it as a PSDU... So, the PLCP layer process the PSDU, put a PLCP-Header + Preamble and that's called a PPDU, and then, the PPDU is passed down into the PMD Sub-Layer (Layer 1 - Lower), the PMD Sub-Layer modulate that into 1's and 0's and send it into the wireless medium.

SDU (Service Data Unit)

- # Piece of information passed by a layer above of the current layer for transmission using the Service of that layer.
- # The amount of information whose identity is preserved when transferred to above Sub-Layer.

PDU (Protocol Data Unit)

- # Information delivered as a whole unit among prior entities of networks containing Control Information, Address Information or Data.
- # In Layers Systems, the PDU represents the unit of Data specified in the protocol of the given layer which consists of Protocol Control Information and User Data (it means: Protocol Header / Info + SDU)
- # A unit of data specified in a protocol and consisting of: Protocol Control Information + Data (it means: Protocol Header / Info + SDU)

  ** EACH LAYER HAS ITS OWN "SDU" & "PDU" # (SDU is "inside" the current layer PDU)

### 💊🖼️📡 Encapuslation: Layer 2 (Data Link) & Layer 1 (PHY) `Sub-Layers`
_**ALL the 802.11b/a/g/n/ac/ax Wi-Fi standards use the terms MSDU, MPDU, PSDU, and PPDU in their frame structures.** These concepts are fundamental to understanding how data is structured and transmitted in Wi-Fi networks according to the various standards. The use of these terms ensures that, regardless of the specific standard (b/a/g/n/ac/ax), the structure and process of data transmission follow a consistent and compatible scheme._

- **`MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit)`**: This is the data unit passed from the Data Link Layer to the Physical Layer. It contains the data information that will be transmitted over the network. <br> <br>
- **`MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit)`**: This is the data unit formed at the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer from one or more MSDUs. It includes headers and frame control sequences necessary for transmission at the MAC level. <br> <br>
- **`PSDU (PLCP Service Data Unit)`**: This is the data unit passed from the MAC layer to the Physical (PHY) layer. The PSDU becomes the payload of the data field in the PPDU frame. <br> <br>
- **`PPDU (PLCP Protocol Data Unit)`**: This is the final data unit transmitted over the physical medium. It includes the PSDU along with the PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) header, which is added at the physical layer to prepare the data for transmission.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

- # In the context of the Data Link and Physical layers of the OSI model, the terms LSDU (Link Service Data Unit) and LPDU (Link Protocol Data Unit) are not standard terms that are widely recognized or used. The more commonly accepted and used terminology includes MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit), MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit), PSDU (Physical Service Data Unit), and PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit).

- # The next example contains LSDU and LPDU for learning pruposes, but some authors or documents might omit terms like LSDU and LPDU because they are not widely standardized and used in official documentation and common practice in networking and telecommunications.

    - LSDU (LLC Service Data Unit)         # (unofficial term) :: LLC sublayer would have LSDU coming from the upper layer and encapsulate into a LPDU to hand off to the MAC sublayer
    - LPDU (LLC Protocol Data Unit)        # (unofficial term) :: LLC sublayer would have LSDU coming from the upper layer and encapsulate into a LPDU to hand off to the MAC sublayer

    - MSDU (MAC Service Data Unit):        # This is the data unit that the MAC sublayer receives from the LLC sublayer.
    - MPDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit):       # This is the data unit that the MAC sublayer transmits to the Physical layer.

    - PSDU (Physical Service Data Unit):   # This is the data unit that the PLCP sublayer receives from the MAC sublayer.
    - PPDU (Physical Protocol Data Unit):  # This is the data unit that the PLCP sublayer transmits through the PMD sublayer.

## Layer 2 Notes

- LLC Sub-Layer (upper) :: # The layer 2 receive all the data from the upper layers (3 to 7) into the LLC sub-layer and encapsulate it in a MSDU. 

- MAC Sub-Layer (lower) :: # When the flow continues to the other Layer 2 sub-layer which is the MAC, the MPDU is created encapsulating the MSDU from the LLC and adding a MAC Header. 

## Layer 1 Notes:

- PLCP Sub-Layer (upper) :: # The PSDU do not add any information to the MPDU, but when the PSDU (in the Layer 1) move down to the PLCP Sub-Layer then have to add the PLCP Header & the PLCP Preamble and the result is the PPDU.

- PMD Sub-Layer (lower)  :: # The PPDU data is transmitted as 1's and 0's through the PMD sublayer. Physically through the wireless medium (RF / air).  

# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

## PLCP & PMD

PLCP

- # PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Procedure) or (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) depending on the version of 802.11

- # The PLCP is the bridge between the MAC and the PMD

- # The PLCP needs to put extra information on the bits that come down from the MAC in order for the PMD to modulate it in such a way the reciever can recieve it.
    - # (This means: PLCP provides PHY layer Framing. => The MAC layer frames are prepended with a PLCP header and a PHY preamble, to create a PHY frame)

PMD

- # Transmits and receives data over the wireless medium (RF traveling through the air)

- # Converts the 1 and 0 provided by the PLCP into an RF signal

### 💊🖼️📦 Layer 1 (Data Link) & Layer 2 (PHY): `Encapsulation`

- The PLCP prepare the frame for transmission by taking the frame from the MAC sublayer & creating PLCP Protocol Data Unit (PPDU).
- PMD sublayer then modulates and transmits the data as bits. When the MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) is handed down to the physical layer it is then referred to as PLCP Service Data Unit (PSDU).
- Note that PSDU & MPDU is refer to the same as it is depend on from which sublayer perspective you looking ( PSDU from PHY sublayer & MPDU from MAC sublayer)
- When PLCP receives PSDU, it then prepares the PSDU to be transmitted & creates PPDU. The PLCP adds a preamble and PHY header to the PSDU.

## 💊🚛🚢 IEEE 802.11: `Frame Aggregation`
_**Frame aggregation allows for more data payload with a single header providing more data transfer with less 802.11 overhead.** With the ratification of 802.11n amendment, two types of frame aggregation were added to 802.11: Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit (A-MSDU) & Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU). Frame aggregation allows multiple smaller MSDU or MPDUs to be grouped together into a single frame, reducing the amount of overhead that would have been necessary for each individual frame.  An analogy for frame aggregation is carpooling that is implemented to reduce traffic and subsequently reduce traffic jams. Similarly, frame aggregation is used to reduce medium contention overhead by combining several service data units (SDUs)._

    - Both solutions (one bus or many cars) have the same capacity to transport the exact same number of people at the same time. <br> <br>
    - However, using `cars` congests the highway much more than just `one bus`, causing issues like more traffic, slower speeds, and increased resource consumption. <br> <br>
    - In contrast, "aggregating" all those people into a `single bus` makes traffic and speed more efficient. <br> <br>
    - The `cars` represent `overhead` (headers, preambles, FCS's, control fields, etc.) and the people represent the `payload` (the relevant data tranmission from point A to point B), the people is traveling in different cars (the classic segmentation into frames containing a payload, as is traditionally done in data transfer over a network). But... **if these people coordinated, they could travel more efficiently in the same bus, as long as they all come from the `same origin` and are going to the `same destination`.** <br> <br>
- This is what Frame Aggregation really does: it significantly reduces overhead and makes Wi-Fi much more efficient.

## 💊🚛 Frame Aggregation: `No Aggregation`
_This is a normal frame traffic without aggregation._

- Each Frame has a LLC-Header, MAC-Header, PLCP-Header and a MSDU (inside the MSDU usually is a payload of data coming from upper layers). <br> <br>
- There is an ACK (Acknowledgement) for each of these frames. <br> <br>
- This generally works for legacy standards like 802.11a; it works good, but it is not very efficient. <br> <br>
- In case of an error, only 1 frame is retransmitted (including again the LLC-Header, MAC-Header, PLCP-Header and a MSDU).

## 💊🚛 Frame Aggregation: `A-MSDU`
_The first frame aggregation method is A-MSDU, where several MSDUs are combined into a single frame. An 802.11n access point uses A-MSDU aggregation and removes the headers and trailers from the received MSDUs, and combines these multiple MSDU payloads in to a single frame, which is known as A-MSDU and is further used for transmission across the wireless medium. The aggregated frame is encrypted using the Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) encryption method. Each MSDU within the A-MSDU must be of the same 802.11e QoS access category. For example, A-MSDU can contain several MSDUs of Video access category only and it cannot be mixed with Best Effort or Voice MSDUs within the same aggregated frame._

- **`A-MSDU Key Concept`**: If you do not receive an Ack frame back, the entire payload must be resent, and this takes up more airtime and induces latency in your network. Congested networks and latency sensitive networks may want to reconsider use of the A-MSDU entirely. <br> <br>
    - **`A-MSDU` is available in `802.11n` _(but A-MPDU is used more)_**
    - **`A-MSDU` is transmitted as a single 802.11 frame with multiple MSDU frames inside it (subframe #1, subframe #2, subrame #3, etc), only having to be sent, and therefore contend, once.**
    - **`A-MSDU` is acknowledged by a standard `ACK` frame**
    - **`A-MSDU` have only one `FCS` for all the MSDU's inside the A-MSDU ({subframe #1 + subframe #2 + subrame #3} + FCS)**
    - **`A-MSDU` have only one `Mac Header` called `A-MSDU Header` for all the MSDU's inside the A-MSDU (Mac Header + {subframe #1 + subframe #2 + subrame #3} + FCS)**
    - **Each MSDU inside the A-MSDU have a small `A-MSDU Sub-Header` to identify information about each subframe (Mac Header + [{Sub-Header}subframe #1 + {Sub-Header}subframe #2 + {Sub-Header}subrame #3] + FCS)** 
    - **`A-MSDU` have a significantly `bigger lenght` compared to a normal MSDU data and compared to regular Ethernet frames** <br><br>
    - `Channel Conditions` :: Preferred in **clean channel** conditions as it aggregates multiple MSDUs into a single MPDU, which is less efficient in noisy environments due to higher retransmission costs.
    - `Encryption` :: A-MSDU Encrypts the entire aggregated data as a single unit. <br><br>

### 💊🚛 Frame Aggregation: `A-MPDU`
_Another method of frame aggregation is A-MPDU, where several MPDUs are combined into a single frame for transmission. Each MPDU of A-MPDU has the same receiver address and data payload and each MPDU is encrypted using the CCMP encryption method. Similar to A-MSDU, each MPDU within the A-MPDU must be of the same 802.11e QoS access category. A-MPDU has more overhead than A-MSDU because each MPDU contains a MAC header and trailer details. **The big difference here is that the transmitter does not merge multiple Ethernet frames into a single 802.11 frame. Every 802.3 frame gets its own 802.11 MAC header and they are aggregated into a single PPDU transmission.**_

- **`A-MPDU Key Concept`**: The A-MPDU method of frame aggregation does not require a single ACK reply, like a A-MSDU method transmission would; Or rather it does but it's not a standard ACK frame. Remember that frame aggregation was introduced with 802.11n alongside a few other frame types, namely the "Block-Ack" Frame type. A block Ack acknowledges a group of frames all at once, and provides a bitmap (Think of like a checklist in this instance) that details what frames, if any, were not received properly. <br> <br>
    - **`A-MPDU` is available in `802.11n`, but is mandatory and the standrard way to send a frame in `802.11ac` y `802.11ax.`, this means: A true VHT or HE frames uses allways A-MPDUs**
    - **All `A-MPDUs` are addressed to the same reciever. _(the STA just look at the MAC-Header of the first MPDU and know if the transmission is for them or not)_**
    - **`A-MPDU` big difference VS A-MSDU is that the transmitter does not merge multiple MSDU's into a single 802.11 frame (better known as A-MSDU). Every MSDU frame gets its own 802.11 MAC header + FCS and they are aggregated into a single PPDU transmission.**
    - **`A-MPDU`** uses a `MPDU delimiter` between each of the MPDU's sent as the aggregated MPDU, this is like an extre Header in order to separate the different MPDU's.
    - **`A-MPDU` works similar as a A-MSDU where has to win one transmit opportunity for the whole A-MPDU in the same contention period, but is less efficient than A-MSDU.**
    - **`A-MPDU` frames are Ack’d via the `Block Ack` frame. The Block Ack has the capability to point out individual sequence numbers that were not received, and only those individual frames have to be retransmitted.**
    - **Compared to the A-MSDU, the A-MPDU has more overhead since every frame has its own MAC header. However, it is also much more resilient because in case of frame loss, only the frames not being Ack’d in the Block Ack have to be retransmitted.** <br><br>
    - `Channel Conditions` :: Preferred in **noisy channel conditions** as it aggregates multiple MPDUs, each acknowledged and retransmitted individually, reducing the impact of errors. <br><br>
    - `Encryption` :: A-MPDU Encrypts each MPDU individually, offering flexibility and better error handling. <br><br>

### 🚛🚢 Frame Aggregation: `Two Level Aggegation - A-MPDU of A-MSDU's` 
_Both of these methods can be used together. It's one of the best ways to increase your throughput to devices that eat a lot of your airtime anyway. The catch here is though you do get the best of both, you get the weaknesses of each, too. Using both together can be a lifesaver, but it should only be used in a low to medium density environment where you have considerable control over the RF environment. The combination of A-MSDU and A-MPDU ist the most efficient method and provides the fastest throughputs in clean environments with low retransmissions. However, as with plain A-MSDU, the cost of retries might be bigger than the benefit of aggregated Ethernet frames inside a single 802.11 frame and **you could be better off with only A-MPDU enabled.**_

### ⬆️ `PLCP`: Physical Layer Convergence Procedure :: `Upper Sublayer`=`Framing`
_Also Known As: Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (depends the 802.11 version). Acts as a bridge between MAC & PMD Sublayer | When Tx = Takes frames from MAC & adds extra information to the bits (PHY Preamble & Header <pre-header|MAC|>) | When Rx = Strip off the PHY Preamble and Header (That's why this data is not seen by protocol analyzers) | This Rx & Tx procedure (adding preamble & header) is called "MAC Framing" | The MAC layer communicates with the Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP) sublayer via primitives (a set of “instructive commands” or “fundamental instructions”) through a Service Access Point (SAP). PLCP is handled by the NIC or Wi-Fi adapter implementation, not the OS, wether it's done: hardware, firmware / microcode, driver running on host, etc._

### ⬇️ `PMD`: Physical Medium Dependant :: Sublayer > `Lower Sublayer`=`Modulation`
_The Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer is the lower half of the Physical Layer (PHY). From a transmission perspective it takes the Physical Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) form the upper half of the PHY and prepares it for transmission across the wireless medium. This means, in the PMD the data modulated and then sent as bits. PMDs further help to define the physical layer of computer network protocols. PMDs define the details of transmission and reception of individual bits (1/0s) on a physical medium, it define the modulation used in the transmission (BPSK, QPSK, QAM256, etc), for example, starting with the minimum data rate available. In Wireless 802.11 scenario, PMD Transmits & Recieve data over Wireless Medium. Converts 1/0 provided by the PLCP into RF signal. The PLCP and PMD sublayers communicate via primitives, through a SAP, to govern the transmission and reception functions._

## ⚙️ 802.11 PHY Layer 1 (PLCP & PMD): `Management Layer Entities`
_Both MAC and PHY layers conceptually include management entities, called the MAC sublayer management entity and the PHY sublayer management entity. These entities are referred to as the MAC Layer Management Entity (MLME), and the Physical Layer Management Entity (PLME). These entities provide the layer management service interfaces through which layer management functions may be invoked. In order to provide correct MAC operation, a station management entity (SME) shall be present within each station._

## 📡⚙️📲 802.11 PHY Layer 1: `Operations`
_The general operation of the various Physical layers is very similar. To perform PLCP functions, the 802.11 standard specifies the use of state
machines. Each state machine performs one of the following 3 functions:_
1. [**`CS/CCA`**: Carrier Sense/Clear Channel Assessment](https://media.techtarget.com/searchMobileComputing/downloads/CWAP_ch8.pdf) 217 | check state of medium | 2 purposes: CS detect start of signal receibable : CCA determine channel clear prior to transmitting 
2. [**`Tx`**: Transmit](https://media.techtarget.com/searchMobileComputing/downloads/CWAP_ch8.pdf) 217 | Used to send individual octets of the data frame after CSA/CA 
3. [**`Rx`**: Receive](https://media.techtarget.com/searchMobileComputing/downloads/CWAP_ch8.pdf) 217 | Used to receive individual octets of the data frame

**The PPDU consist of 3 parts:**

1. Preamble
2. PLCP Header
3. PSDU

**How PPDU is encapsulated & transmitted:**

- When the PLCP layer receives the PSDU from the MAC layer, the appropriate PLCP Preamble & PLCP Header are added to the PSDU to create PPDU.
- When transmitting data, the Tx STA alerts the Rx STA of transmission by sending PLCP Preamble at the beginning of transmission.

**Different preambles for each PHY Standard:**

1. Long PLCP Preamble :: (802.11b)
2. Short PLCP Preamble :: (802.11b)
3. OFDM PLCP Preamble :: (802.11a/g)
4. _**3 Additional Preambles :: **(802.11n)_

**802.11n amendment further defines 3 additional preambles in 3 different PPDU.**

    - # Includes a known pattern of 1's and 0's, when seen by other STAs they will know that a frame is coming. 

    - # Provides time for the receiver to detect the signal and synchronise with the signal.

        - # **/ Sent at the most robust Data Rate (lowest Data Rate in the band):

            - 2.4 GHz = #  1 Mbps / 2 Mbps
            - 5 GHz   = #  6 Mbps

- PLCP Header:

    - # Communicates important information about the forthcoming PSDU such as Lenght and Data Rate.

    - # Information of the PLCP-Header is often shown in the Radio Tap Header or PPI section of a protocol decode.

        - # **/ Sent the Data Rate speciefied by the PHY:

            - HR-DSSS = # Long Preamble  :: 1 Mbps
            - HR-DSSS = # Short Preamble :: 2 Mbps
            - ERP, OFDM, HT, VHT = #     :: 6 Mbps

- IMPORTANT NOTE:

#   - When you see a data frame with for example 256 Mbps of Data Rate, remember that the frame is using that Data Rate only for the data transmission,
#     but the PHY information will always be sent at the lowest Data Rate of the PHY or band.

## 🔝📡🗂️ 802.11 Pseudo-Headers: `Radiotap`, `plus AVS Radio Information`, `PPI`
_Radiotap is a de facto standard for 802.11 frame injection and reception | The radiotap header format is a mechanism to supply additional information about frames, from the driver to userspace applications such as libpcap, and from a userspace application to the driver for transmission. | Data that is NOT present in a 802.11 MAC-frame, but is intepreted coming from the PHY-Layer 1 (spectrum) derived from the PLCP header. Additional information (Meta-Information) that is added to each 802.11 frame when capturing frames with an analysis application interpreted/calculated because the PHY layer 1 spectrum throught drivers/adapters. These are not part of the standard 802.11 frame format, but are additional information added at the time of capture to provide supplementary data about the frames captured | **Some adapters capture Radiotap Header & Radio Information, other drivers can capture PPI & Radio Information**_

### 💊📦 `Duration / ID` :: _2 Bytes / 16 Bits_
_2 Bytes / 16 bits long AKA 2 Octates | The duration field in a mac header has a two different purposes: 1 ) Duration: This field is used to reset NAV timers for devices on channel. Time in microseconds needed to complete the frame exchange, used to update STAs NAV (Network Allocation Vector). This is used a lot and it's important to know that this is not the duration of the current frame, it is the duration of the exchanges after the current frame requeried to actually complete the transaction 2) ID: Used in legacy PS-poll Frame to indicate the AID (Association ID) of the STA (AKA: ID of the Client Station given to the AP) to send the buffered frame in the AP | Expected duration of current transmission. Stations waiting for the medium use this to estimate when the channel will be free. | The contents of this field vary with frame type and subtype, with whether the frame is transmitted during the CFP, and with the QoS capabilities of the sending STA. | Omni peek shows this as duration, however it really is a duration / id field._

    - 🛈 The frame is part of an `ad-hoc network` / The frame is `Management` or `Control` frame.
    - 🛈 The frame is **not intended to leave the wireless environment**: `Management` and `Control` frames will always have the To DS and From DS fields set to 0 and are never sent to the distribution system network. (eg. an `Association Response` or `Beacon` will have **To DS** = 0 and **From DS** = 0) <br> <br>

    - 🛈 The frame **is leaving the wireless environment** and is intended for a computer on the distribution system network.
    - 🛈 For example after a wireless station authenticates it will **need to obtain an IP address and that request will be forwarded by the AP to the DHCP server** that resides on the distribution system network. <br> <br>

        - `Address 2` = Source
        - `Address 3` = Destination <br> <br>
- 📍 **To DS** field is `0` and **From DS** field is `1`: <br> <br> 
    - 🛈 The packet **is entering the wireless environment coming from the DS.**

        - `Address 3` = Source <br> <br>
- 📍 **To DS** and **From DS** fields are `both 1`: <br> <br>
    - 🛈 The frame is involved with a `wireless distribution system (WDS)` network.
    - 🛈 WDS networks are used to connect multiple networks together, typically for building-to-building connectivity, or a WDS can connect access points together to from a wireless mesh network. <br> <br>

**Important notes on `Addresses`:**

- `Management` frames **use three of the four available address fields** in an 802.11 frame `Addresses 1 to 3`. A management frame is also known as MAC Management Protocol Data Unit (MMPDU) and they do not use the Address 4 field which is only used with a mesh basic service set. <br> <br>
- `RTS` frames **uses only two available address fields** in an 802.11 frame `Addresses 1 to 2`. <br> <br>
- `CTS` frames **uses only one address field** in an 802.11 frame `Address 1`. <br> <br>
- `Address 1` is always the `receiver address (RA)`.
- `Address 2` is always the `transmitter address (TA)`.

        
**Each of the four 802.11 Address Fields may have one of 5 different interpretations:**

1. ⭕ `Destination Address` : **`DA`** :: Final Destination of Transmission <br> <br>
    - DA (F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0) = `wlan.da == F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0` <br> <br>

3. ⭕ `Receiver Address` : **`RA`** :: Next Wireless Destination of the Transmission <br> <br>
    - RA (F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0) = `wlan.ra == F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0` <br> <br>
4. ⭕ `Transmitter Address` : **`TA`** :: STA/AP that transmitted the frame onto the WM (Wireless Medium)  <br> <br>
    - TA (F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0) = `wlan.ta == F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0` <br> <br>
5. ⭕ `Basic Service Set Identifier` : **`BSSID`** :: ID of the BSS (Similar to MAC Address) <br> <br>
    - TA (F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0) = `wlan.bssid == F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0` <br> <br>

**Filter specific MAC of any hardware address (AP or STA) of any 5 Addresses:**

- ⭕ `Any AP or STA client traffic` : **`WLAN Address`** :: ID of any hardware antenna transmission <br> <br>
    - STA or AP (F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0) = `wlan.addr == F0:F0:F0:F0:F0:F0` <br> <br>
- ⭕ `Any AP or STA client traffic` : **`WLAN Address OUI`** :: Filter only for the OUI MAC "F0:F0:F0: _xx:xx:xx_" <br> <br>

These UP values of a wireless frame map to QoS field (CoS/802.1D) of a 802.1q header when it translated to Ethernet frame ;; WiFi alliance QoS certification called WMM-WiFi Multimedia also defined those 4 access categories. So WMM cetified end client should classified its traffic on to one of those classes prior to transmit them over the air. | QoS Control field is comprised of five subfields: 1. Traffic Identifier (TID) also known as UP (User Priority) 2. End of Service Period (EOSP) 3. ACK Policy 4. Reserved 5. TXOP limit, TXOP duration, AP PS buffer state, Queue Size_

**Key Points:**

- CW (Contention Window): CWmin and CWmax values define the contention window size range, which affects how long a station waits before attempting to access the medium. <br> <br>
- AIFSN (Arbitration Inter-Frame Space Number): determines the priority of the access category; lower values mean higher priority. <br> <br>
- 802.11 UP (User Priority): corresponds to the 802.1D service classes and dictates the type of traffic being prioritized. <br> <br>

With this HT Control field max MAC header length increased to 36 bytes. | The way it works is that the first bit that was reserved in 802.11n, now is used to determine if it's using VHT when the bit is set to 1, if it's set to 0 it means that the HT control is saying that the frame is 802.11n HT frame || The 802.11n amendment add a 4 byte HT control field to the 802.11 MAC header. With this HT Control field max MAC header length increased to 36 bytes. | HT Control Field is **always present in a Control Wrapper frame** and is present in **QoS Data and management frames as determined by the order bit of the Frame Control Field**. **The only Control Frame subtype for which HT Control field present is the Control Wrapper frame**. A control frame  that is described as + HTC (eg RTS+HTC, BlockAckReq+HTC, PS-Poll+HTC) implies the use of Control Wrapper frame to carry the control frame. Below show the frame format of a Control Wrapper | If it is a **QoS Data frame or management frame, if HT Control Field is present then Order bit of the Frame Control field set to 1** (usually this bit used to indicate strict order processing on 802.11 frames, but with 802.11e QoS this bit is reused for indicate presence of HT control field)._

````py
## HT Control :: 32-bit (4 bytes) field that has two forms: HT & VHT variants. VHT set to 0 indicate HT variant & 1 indicate a VHT variant

   # HT Control field is only present in: Control Frames = Control Wrapper Frames || QoS Data & Management Frames with +HTC/Order bit = 1

   # The HT Control field is used to manage advanced quality of service (QoS) and network coordination features in high-throughput 802.11n/ac/ax frames.

### 💊📦 802.11 `Frame Body` - Variable Lenght Frame Body
_The Frame Body is a variable length field that contains information specific to individual frame types and subtypes. | The minimum size of the frame body can be 0 bytes (0 bits, 0 octets). This occurs in certain types of control frames or management frames, such as ACK (Acknowledgment) frames, beacon frames or CTS/RTS, which may not carry a frame body. The maximum size of the frame body varies depending on the specific 802.11 standard and network configuration. The maximum length frame body is defined by the maximum length (MSDU + ICV + IV), where ICV and IV are the WEP fields. | The frame body for data frames has an upper layer payload / data | The frame body for management frames like beacons, have informations elements._

### 💊📦 802.11 `FCS` - Frame Check Sequence 32-bit CRC (Cicle Redundancy Check) :: _4 Bytes / 32 Bits_
_The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is a 4-byte field in a data frame used for transmission error detection, this is calculated using the whole MAC Frame (MAC Header + Frame Body). If the calculaton does not match it means the frame have a "CRC Error" and is reported on the protocol analyzer as "corrputed frame". This does not mean an error in the network all of the times, but maybe in the location the frame is captured the modulation is not working, for example, bad signal or distance from the AP | The sender calculates the FCS using the CRC-32 algorithm and appends it to the frame. The receiver recalculates the CRC-32 upon receiving the frame and compares it to the received FCS to check for errors. | Wireshark uses the standard CRC-32 algorithm to compute the CRC of the frame data (excluding the FCS) and then compares this computed value to the FCS appended to the frame. If they match, the frame is considered "good"; otherwise, it is "bad". | The FCS field contains a number that is calculated by the source node based on the data in the frame. This number is added to the end of a frame that is sent. When the destination node receives the frame the FCS number is recalculated and compared with the FCS number included in the frame. If the two numbers are different, an error is assumed and the frame is discarded._

## Example of Calculation and Comparison: FCS -->> CRC

    # Suppose we capture a frame with the following data (in hexadecimal):

        - Data:     00 1A 2B 3C 4D 5E 6F 7A 8B 9C
        - FCS:      DE 1F F2 56

    # the procedure would be:

        - Frame Data (excluding FCS):

        - DATA = 00 1A 2B 3C 4D 5E 6F 7A 8B 9C

    # Calculate CRC-32:

        - Initialize CRC to = 0xFFFFFFFF

        - Perform the CRC calculation iteratively on each byte.

    # Resulting CRC-32:

        - Suppose the CRC-32 calculation yields DE 1F F2 56.

    # Comparison:

        - The calculated CRC-32 DE 1F F2 56 is compared to the FCS DE 1F F2 56.

        - Result = Since they match, Wireshark marks the FCS as "good".

## =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

## Basic pseudocode for the CRC-32 calculation in python:

def crc32(data):
    crc = 0xFFFFFFFF
    for byte in data:
        crc ^= byte
        for _ in range(8):
            if (crc & 1):
                crc = (crc >> 1) ^ 0xEDB88320
            else:
                crc >>= 1
    return crc ^ 0xFFFFFFFF

# Example usage:

data = [0x00, 0x1A, 0x2B, 0x3C, 0x4D, 0x5E, 0x6F, 0x7A, 0x8B, 0x9C]
calculated_crc = crc32(data)

# Results: The "calculated_crc" variable is what Wireshark calculates and compares to the FCS in the frame.

# 🛜🦈💊 802.11 MAC Frames Types
_802.11 frames are categorized into three main types: **Management, Control & Data**. Each frame type serves a specific purpose and contains various subtypes, allowing for a wide range of functionalities within the wireless network. The division of 802.11 frames into management, control, and data frames allows for a robust and efficient mechanism to handle various aspects of wireless communication. Management frames ensure proper network operation and device association, control frames manage access to the wireless medium and ensure collision-free communication, while data frames carry the actual payload necessary for user applications. Understanding these frames and their subtypes is crucial for network professionals to design, manage, and troubleshoot WLANs effectively._

## ⚙️🛜💊 802.11 MAC Frames :: `Management`
_IEEE 802.11-2020 9.3.3 (PV0) :: Management frames are used to manage the connections and maintenance of communication between devices within a WLAN. These frames are crucial for tasks such as discovering and joining networks, authenticating devices, and maintaining network associations._ 

**Primary functions of Management Frames:** 
- **`Network discovery and association`**: Frames like Beacon, Probe Request, and Probe Response are used by devices to discover networks and initiate connections. <br><br>
- **`Authentication and deauthentication`**: Frames such as Authentication and Deauthentication facilitate secure connections between client STAs (stations) and APs (access points). <br><br>
- **`Network maintenance`**: Frames like Association Request, Association Response, and Disassociation are used to maintain and manage active connections. <br><br>
- **`Power Management`**: Frames like ATIM allow devices to announce pending data transmissions to other devices in a power-saving mode, ensuring that they remain active to receive the data. <br><br>
- **`Actions`**: Action frames extend the functionality of management frames, enabling advanced features like spectrum management, QoS management, and radio measurement. They allow for a wide range of actions, from channel switching to initiating protected dual of public action frames for more complex operations <br><br>

**Key Notes on Management Frames**
- 802.11 management frames use fields and elements also known as Information Elements. The elements are in the frame body as a management frame does not contain a data payload.
- 802.11 management frames that are sent to a broadcast address of FF FF FF FF FF FF will have a duration value of zero. The duration is a time value that STA’s will use to reserve the medium informing other STA’s in the BSS how long it will take for the frame exchange to complete. In this case since these frames are no acknowledged by a receiver they have a duration value of zero. The duration field is still in the MAC header but it is not used.
- According to the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard, there are 12 management frame subtypes: Association request, Association response, Reassociation request, Reassociation response, Probe request, Probe response, Beacon, Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM), Disassociation, Authentication, Deauthentication & Action.

## 🎮🛜💊 802.11 MAC Frames :: `Control`
_Control frames are used to manage access to the wireless medium and ensure that data transmissions occur smoothly without collisions, this means that the Control frames are used to assist with the delivery of the data frames such as 802.11 acknowledgement (Ack), request to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS) and more. These frames are essential for coordinating data transfer and managing the state of communication links._

**Key functions of Control Frames:**
- **`Acknowledgment`**: Frames like ACK are used to acknowledge the receipt of data frames, ensuring reliable communication. <br><br>
- **`Medium reservation`**: Frames such as RTS (Request to Send) and CTS (Clear to Send) help in reserving the medium for transmission, reducing the likelihood of collisions. <br><br>
- **`Power management`**: Frames like PS-Poll are used by client STAs to manage power-saving modes, allowing them to conserve energy while maintaining network connectivity. <br><br>

**Advanced tasks of Control Frames:**
- **`Trigger`**: Used in multi-user transmission scenarios, particularly in 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). They initiate scheduled uplink transmissions from multiple client STAs, allowing for efficient use of the wireless medium. <br><br>
- **`Beamforming Report Poll`**: Utilized in 802.11ac and newer standards, these frames request beamforming feedback from client STAs to optimize directional signal transmission, enhancing overall network performance. <br><br>
- **`VHT/HE NDP Announcement`**: Announce the start of a null data packet (NDP) transmission for Very High Throughput (VHT) and High Efficiency (HE) modes, used for channel sounding and beamforming purposes. <br><br>
- **`Control Frame Extension and Control Wrapper frames`**: Provide additional control signaling capabilities beyond the basic control frame functions, supporting enhanced features and future extensions of the 802.11 standards.

Key Notes on Control Frames: 
- Control frames are used to assist with the delivery of the data frames such as 802.11 acknowledgement (Ack), request to send (RTS) and clear to send (CTS) and more.

## 📡🔍⚙️ Management Frames: `Beacon`
_Fixed Schedule (default 100TU (Time Unit) = 1024us microseconds) | Sent always at Lowest Basic Data Rate configured |_
- [**`Beacon`** :: Frame Decode @ Nayanajith](https://mrncciew.com/2014/10/08/802-11-mgmt-beacon-frame/) Fixed Schedule (default 100TU = 1024us microseconds) | Lowest Basic Data Rate
- [`Beacon Frame Body` :: Elements](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9363693) IEEE 802.11-2020: Table 9-32 | 9.3.3.2
- TBTT: The target beacon transmission time (TBTT) determines the rate at which Beacon management frames are sent. This value is 1,024 microseconds and usually multiplied by 100 time units (TU’s) which will allow the Beacon interval to be 102.4 milliseconds.

## 🤳🏾🔍⚙️ 802.11 Management Frames: `Probe Request` & `Probe Response`
_STAs send Probe Request on Active Scanning or after a Beacon in Passive Scanning | APs does not response an ACK from a Probe Request, AP responds with Probe Response directly (broadcast 802.11 Frames are neved ACKed) | Directed Probe Request conain SSID or wildcard set & Probe Request (broadcast) is sent empty bit_

Important Notes of Probe Request & Responses:

- The Probe Response frame from an access point is identical to a Beacon management from with the exception of the traffic indication map (TIM) that is used for power save mechanisms. The Non-Greenfield HT STAs Present field is in Beacon and Probe Response frames.
- [**`Probe Request`**]() **STA** -> Broadcast `APs does not ACK Probe Req` :: Broadcast :: Lowest STA's Data Rate :: 
- [**`Directed Probe Request`**]() **STA** -> AP `APs does not ACK Probe Req` :: AP/SSID Directed ::
- [**`Probe Response`**]() STA <- **AP** `STAs ACK Probes Res` :: Lowest BSS Data Rate :: Includes SSID & Very similar to a Beacon

- The SSID information element is in a Beacon, Probe Request, Probe Response, Association Request and Reassociation request. The Association Response does not contain the SSID information element. The 802.11 association process verifies capabilities between a client STA and an access point.


### Reassociation Request & Response
- The Association Request and Reassociation Request frames are nearly identical with the exception of the current AP address field. This field is used to assist in moving the STA association to the new access point. A STA can be associated to only one access point at a time.

## Control Frames

- `ADDBA`: Action frames are management frames that are for various types of actions. This includes block acknowledgements. The add a block ACK (ADDBA) request and response frames are used for the block ACK setup process between STA’s
























































        
# 🪆🛜⚙️ 802.11 State Machine: `Discovery`, `Authentication`, `Association`, `Transition` & `Disconnection`
_Any Client Station or Access Point (STA or AP) can be in some "state" within this state machine at any given time. Considered as "The discovery/connection/transition/disconnection process" of a client in a BSS at a protocol level. Modern networks does not "authenticate" clients, instead uses "open system authentication". Open System Authentication is when STA send Auth Req & AP responds with Auth Res, then the same with Asso Res/Res at this point they are at "state 3" (where open authentication reach), then is where we use RSN method is used (like 802.1X EAP or WPA2 PSK) to make a "real authentication", and that take us finally to state 4 "Fully connected to the network"Most common issues to torubleshoot are Connectivity Problems, this means: STAs/Clients either can't connect, can't maintain it's connection, it's not roaming well between APs, it can't connect to the SSID, and so on... Understanding this kind of Frame Exchanges help to analyze step by step the process for BSS Discovery & Joining, Analyze Roaming Behavior, etc_

## 🪪🛡️🔐 IEEE 802.11: `Authentication`
_These are the Authentication Methods a STA can use to access to a BSS | IEEE Std 802.11 defines five 802.11 authentication methods: Open System authentication, Shared Key authentication, FT authentication, and simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE), and fast initial link setup (FILS) authentication. Open System authentication admits any STA to the DS. Shared Key authen-tication relies on WEP to demonstrate knowledge of a WEP encryption key. FT authentication relies on keys derived during the initial mobility domain association to authenticate the stations as defined in Clause 12 (Fast BSS transition). SAE authentication uses finite field cryptography to prove knowledge of a shared password. FILS authentication uses either trusted public keys or a shared key derived out-of-band.  FILS authentication uses three alternative procedures._

### 📡🪪 Wi-Fi Connection Manager Protocols
_To facilitate Wi-Fi connectivity, the industry introduced WISPr 1.0, a protocol which automated the exchange of user name/password credentials with public Wi-Fi HotSpots. | In 2010, Accuris introduced WISPr 1+ extensions to the WISPr protocol which overcame the security flaws and subscriber management complexity of the initial specification. | Today WISPr 1+ is used by Wi-Fi roaming service providers worldwide to offer seamless, secure access and authentication on WISPr-enabled Wi-Fi networks. | Wi-Fi Hotspots need to support 802.1X technology as part of a HotSpot 2.0 upgrade. While many do, WISPr continues to be the predominant access mechanism. With WISPr 1+, service providers are able to bring a SIM-like authentication to non-SIM devices and non-802.1X Wi-Fi alike, and to an installed base of Smartphones which doesn’t support EAP-SIM/AKA today._

# 🛡️🔓🪪 Authentication Method: `Open System`
_Once a client station is discover a SSID (Probe Request/Response or listening to Beacons) it move to Join phase. This exchange comprise of at least 4 frames || Open System authentication should never fail || Init method of authentication used by most modern WLANs || RSN like 802.1X or PSK is performed later (state 3 > 4) || There is no "authentication response frame", it's just an "autentication frame" with another status code value || Association process is similar to authentication, in this caso we do have "authentication request" & "authentication response" (both ACKed) ||_

# 🛡️🔓🪪 Authentication Method: `SKA: Shared Key Authentication`
_**Shared Key Authentication (SKA) is simply not used anymore, it is insecure and already PWNEd, never use it!!!.** | Shared Key Authentication (SKA) is a verification process by which a computer can gain access to a wireless network that uses the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol. With SKA, a computer equipped with a wireless modem can fully access any WEP network and exchange encrypted or unencrypted data. Shared Key authentication uses WEP when authenticating client stations and requires that a static WEP key be configured on both the station and the AP. In addition to WEP being mandatory, authentication will not work if the static WEP keys do not match. The authentication process is similar to Open System authentication but includes a challenge and response between the AP and client station. | **SKA/WEP is vulneable to: IV Collision Attack, Weak Key attack, Reinjection Attack.**_

### Shared Key Authentication: `WEP Authentication Process`
_Shared Key Authentication uses WEP(Wireless Equivlanet Privacy) to authenticate client stations & that require a static WEP key configured on both AP & Client._

````py
## SKA (Shared Key Authentication) process:

1 - # First, clientc STA send the "Authentication Request" to the AP. The "SEQ No is 1" for this frame & Authentication algorithm is "Shared Key".

2 - # Then, AP sends a cleartext challenge to the client STA in an authentication response. The SEQ number is “2” & challenge Text is included.

3 - # The client STA then encrypt the cleartext challenge and sends it back to the AP in the body of another authentication request frame. The WEP header information contains encrypted data.
    By using the WEP key in wireshark it's possible to decrypt this message. Then, the Sequence number 3 where AP send cleartext was encrypted using WEP.
    
4 - # Once AP get the WEP encrypted authentication message 3, AP decrypt client STA response & compare it with the cleartext challenge.
    If they match AP will respond by sending forth & final authentication frame to the station.

### Shared Key Authentication: `WEP Encryption Process`
_WEP initialization vector (IV) include the WEP KEY ID details where receiving device can identify which key has been used for encryption.(so it can properly decrypt traffic). MSDU & ICV information will be go as encrypted text._

````py

1 - # 24 bit cleartext IV(Initialization Vector) is randomly generated & combined with static secret key.

2 - # Key length is 40bits in 64bit WEP & key length would be 104bits in 128bit WEP.

3 - # IV & Key with RC4 pseudo-random algorithm generate a keystream.

4 - # Resulted key stream are then combined with plaintext data bits using XOR process.

5 - # End result is the WEP ciphertext.

6 - # WEP also run CRC on plaintext data & append as 32 bit ICV(Integrity Check Value) to the end  of plain text data.

7 - # WEP add 8 byte (4-IV, 4-ICV) encryption overhead resulting max MSDU from 2304 to 2312 bytes.

## 🔐🔣🤐 802.11i Security: `Encryption Methods` & `Cipher Suites`
_Encryption is a process by which information is converted into an unreadable or unintelligible format for those who do not have the key to decrypt it. | Cipher suites are sets of cryptographic algorithms used together to provide comprehensive security in communications. They include algorithms for encryption, but they can also address authentication and data integrity. | Differences: While Encryption is a specific process within the broader scope of cipher suites. Cipher suites not only focus on data encryption but also address other aspects of communication security, such as authentication and integrity. In the context of protocols like TLS/SSL, the negotiation of cipher suites during the handshake is essential to establish a secure connection between a client and an online server. In the context of Wi-Fi authentication, the negotiation of cipher suites is crucial during the handshake process. This negotiation helps establish a secure connection between a device and a Wi-Fi access point by determining the encryption methods that will safeguard the wireless communication._ <br><br>

## 🪪🗝️🔐 802.11i: `Authentication & Key Management` & `4-Way-Handshake`
_802.11i introduces key management schemes that allow for a separate authentication process to enable the distribution of keys. There are two main phases to this process: Master key establishment & Key exchange | Master key establishment can occur either manually via configuration or dynamically via the 802.1x protocol using EAP. After master keys are established, two parties perform key exchange to generate the transient keys they will use for the session. Although the term "key exchange" is used in the specification and in the literature, in reality this is a negotiation phase in which no actual keys are exchanged. | When using RSNA like 802.1X-EAP or WPA2/3-PSK the end goal is get security in the WLAN connection, to achieve that security the STA & AP (& authenticator server in case of 802.1X) need to make a key exchange for traffic encryption (similar like protocols like SSH or HTTPS) | In an AP with many wireless clients, unicast traffic between a wireless client and the AP has to be private. You don’t want one client to be able to decrypt traffic between another wireless client and the AP. This is why you should have different keys between each wireless Client & AP. We call these pairwise keys because there is a pair of keys between each wireless client and the AP. The AP has multiple pairwise keys, one for each associated wireless client. | There is also broadcast and multicast traffic. All wireless clients should be able to encrypt and decrypt this traffic, so we need a shared key | All associated wireless clients of the AP have the same key. We call this a group key. The Pairwise and group keys are created differently. | Key partitioning in cryptography means dividing (partitioning) a single key into a set of keys. One of the advantages of dividing a key into parts is that the security of the key improves. An attacker needs all parts of the partitioned keys to recover the original key._

# 🗝️🔐🏢 00-0F-AC-01: `802.1X Protocol` & `EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)`
_EAP is the whole Framework used for implement authentication, and it uses 802.1X as a part of it | 802.1X is a port access protocol designed to secure networks through authentication. As a result, this type of authentication method is extremely useful in the Wi-Fi environment due to the nature of the medium. If a Wi-Fi user authenticates through 802.1X to access the network, a virtual port is opened on the access point, allowing communication. If not authorized correctly, no virtual port will be available, and communications will be blocked. | EAP is used to transmit authentication information between the "Supplicant" (STA) and the "Authentication Server" (Microsoft IAS or AD, RADIUS, etc). The specific type of EAP actually manages and defines the authentication process. The AP acting as the "Authenticator" serves as a proxy facilitating communication between the "Supplicant" (STA) <--> Authentication Server (RADIUS, Windows Server, etc). | There are upwards of 40 EAP methods, including several commonly used ones that are often called inner methods or tunneled EAP methods. Some of the most commonly deployed EAP authentication types include EAP-MD-5, EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-Fast, and Cisco LEAP._ <br>

**Basic components in 802.1X authentication:** <br>
**Supplicant**: A software client running on the Wi-Fi workstation (STA).<br>
**Authenticator** or **NAS**: The Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). <br>
**Authentication Server**: An authentication database, typically a RADIUS server such as Cisco ACS, Funk Steel-Belted RADIUS, or Microsoft IAS. <br>

- [`EAP-MD5`: Message Digest 5](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Basic EAP support | Not recommended for Wi-Fi implementations (insecure) | Non-Dynamic per session keys
- [`LEAP` (Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Not recommended for Wi-Fi implementations (insecure) | Used primarily in Cisco Aironet* WLANs & other Cisco compatible devices. 
- [`PEAP` (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Tunneling between PEAP clients and an authentication server. Microsoft, Cisco, and RSA Security developed PEAP.
- [`EAP-TLS`: Transport Layer Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Certificate-Based & Mutual Auth (Client-Server) | Dynamically generate user-based & session-based WEP keys
- [`EAP-TTLS`: Tunneled Transport Layer Security](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Extension of EAP-TLS. Unlike EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS requires only server-side certificates.
- [`EAP-FAST`: Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) by Cisco* | Instead of using certificates, authenticates by PAC
- [`EAP-SIM`: Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for GSM Subscriber Identity](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) Uses the GSM SIM (cellular network). 
- [`EAP-AKA`: Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for UMTS Authentication and Key Agreement](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000006999/wireless/legacy-intel-wireless-products.html) uses UMTS & USIM modules | USIM is a special smart card used with cellular networks

_The 802.11w standard aims to protect control and management frames and a set of robust management frames against forgery and replay attacks. The frame types protected include Disassociation, Deauthentication, and Robust Action frames such as: Spectrum management, 
Quality of Service (QoS), Block Ack, Radio measurement, Fast Basic Service Set (BSS) Transition. | 802.11w does not encrypt the frames, however, it protects the management frames. It ensures that the messages come from legitimate sources. In order to do that, you have to add a Message Integrity Check (MIC) element | These extensions interact with IEEE 802.11r & IEEE 802.11u._

_In this case the STA connect to the AP1 using the complete association process (Open-Association, Open-Authentication, 802.1X-EAP, 4-way-handshake), then the STA moves to the AP2 and do the complete association process again (Open-Association, Open-Authentication, 802.1X-EAP, 4-way-handshake)... but when STA return to the AP1, it will only do only 3 stages of association process without 802.1X-EAP (Open-Association, Open-Authentication, 4-way-handshake)_

## 🪪 `RADIUS`: Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
_Networking protocol that provides centralized Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for users who connect and use a network service. RADIUS was developed by Livingston Enterprises in 1991 as an access server authentication and accounting protocol. It was later brought into IEEE 802 and IETF standards. | RADIUS is a client/server protocol that runs in the application layer, and can use either TCP or UDP. Network access servers, which control access to a network, usually contain a RADIUS client component that communicates with the RADIUS server. | RADIUS is often the back-end of choice for 802.1X authentication. | A RADIUS server is usually a background process running on UNIX or Microsoft Windows._ <br>

# 🛜🚦🛑 Medium Access Methods & QoS
_Once a STA is connected to a WLAN via an AP, the STA need to communicate somehow. This is where Medium Access takes place! The "Medium" is RF (Radio Frequency) & is shared, if there are 60 devices (STA) connected to an AP & other 30 connected to another AP and both are on same channel, those are 90 devices sharing the medium or the same Frequency Space for RF (AKA "air" or "airtime"). The STAs & APs must have a way to "negotiate" who is gonna "talk" and "when" | By other hand, we need to know which frames has more priority in the network and needs to go first, that's what QoS is all about | MAC methods = How to get acces to the medium | QoS = Decide what to put on that medium first once medium access is gained._

## 👨🏻‍⚖️🚦 Arbitration & DCF: `Network Arbitration`
_In every 802.11 network there must be a set of rules to determine when stations can transmit. Arbitration is just deciding "who" is gonna talk "when", in WLAN Networks there are rules to determine when STA can transmit into the medium (RF) | There are 2 types of methods: Contention Methods & Contention Free Methods (Token Ring Legacy = Contention Free | CSM-CA & DCF (default Wi-Fi), CSMA-CD (eth) modern = Contention Method)_

### Contention Methods

- CSMA/CD: Ethernet 802.3 :: Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collition Detection. <br><br>
- CSMA/CA: Wi-Fi 802.11 :: Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collition Avoidance _(This method uses by default DCF (Distributed Coordination Function)._

### Contention Free Methods

- Token Passing: Obsolete / Not used :: for Token Ring puproses
- PCF (Point Coordination Function): Obsolete / Not used :: Alternative 802.11 Wireless method NOT implemented






## 🚦💥🚥 CSMA/CA (DCF)
_The fundamental Network Access Method known as "Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collition Avoidance". DCF is the process by which CSMA/CA is applied to Wi-Fi networks and can be found in the 802.11-1997 standard._

- DCF is what sometimes is called "CSMA/CA"
- DCF is used in **non-QoS WLANs**
- Carrier sense involves devices checking whether the wireless medium is busy or idle. These processes are what make up CSMA/CA

This simplified process is followed for every frame transmission to ensure that every device gets equal opportunity to transmit. This equal opportunity is the “multiple access” part of CSMA/CA:

- In Wi-Fi, not considering any multi-user transmissions, devices take turns sending one at a time: <br><br>
    - While one device transmits, all the others listen, even if the frame is not destined for the listeners. _(This concept comes from the use of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA))_. <br><br>
    - After the transmitting device is done sending data, all devices that wish to transmit will follow a similar process. _(It involves waiting a calculated random amount of time and checking to see if other devices are transmitting.)_ <br><br>
        - **If other devices are not transmitting**: The device will request control of the medium and begin transmitting. <br><br>
        - **If other stations are transmitting**: The device will set a timer for itself based on the duration of the transmission from the other device. 

### CSMA/CA:

- **`CS` = `Carrier Sense`**:
    - Is the medium free? Is there anyone else transmitting? 
        - **Physical** Carrier Sense 
        - **Virtual** Carrier Sense  <br><br>
- **`MA` = `Multiple Access`**:
    - Half Duplex Medium
    - Multiple Stations Contending for Access to the medium (because the stations are sharing the medium) <br><br>
- **`CA` = `Collision Avoidance`**:
    - Attempting to avoid collisions (attempting!!! because it's impossible to prevent it 100%, that's why we are **avoiding**, **not preventing**): 
        - We cannot always detect collisions in a wireless enviorment. (We can prevent it using random back offs, using some algrythms to help us decrease the number of colissions that may occur)
        - We back off everytime medium becomes free 

**DCF defines four components to ensure devices share the medium equally:** 

1. **`Physical Carrier Sense`**: Process of a device checking the frequency **(at physical layer)** to determine whether the medium is in use or not. It can detect both: **802.11 signals** (reading the PHy preamble) and **NON 802.11 signals** (measuring the RF energy) <br><br>
2. **`Virtual Carrier Sense`**: Process of a device to determine whether the medium is in use or not using information of the **MAC Frame Headers**: **Duration Field** & **NAV** <br><br>
3. **`Random Back-off timers`**: 
4. **`IFS (Interframe Spaces)`**: Periods of time between frames; they are used to allow frames to be processed in a timely manner, avoid interference by ensuring frames are received, and prioritize transmission of certain frames.

### These are the steps a station go through prior to transmit a frame to the wireless medium:

1. # STAs use a physical carrier sense (Clear Channel Assessment—CCA) to determine if the wireless medium is busy.

2. # STAs use virtual carrier sense (Network Allocation Vector—NAV) to detect if the medium is busy. When the virtual timer (NAV) reaches zero, STAs may proceed.

3. # If conditions 1 and 2 are met, STAs wait the necessary IFS interval, as prescribed by the protocol.

4. # If conditions 1 and 2 are met through the duration of condition 3, STAs generate a random backoff number in accordance with the range of allowed values.

5. # STAs begin decrementing the backoff timer by one for every slot time duration that the wireless medium is idle.

6. # After decrementing the backoff value to zero, with an idle medium, a STA may transmit the allotted frame exchange, in accordance with the parameters of the obtained transmission opportunity (TXOP).

7. # If another STA transmits before Step 6 is completed, STAs observe steps 1, 2, 3, and 5 until the backoff timer is equal to zero.

8. # After a successful transmission, repeat as needed.

## 🛜🪨🧏 DCF: `Physical Carrier Sense`
_Physical Carrier Sense is the process of a device checking the frequency (at physical layer) to determine whether the medium is in use or not._

Physical Carrier Sense is based on CCA (Clear Channel Assessment). CCA asks the Physical Layer: "Is there anyone else transmitting"?. **This means that CCA determines if the channel is clear before transmission.** To do that CCA uses 2 different components: 

1. **`Carrier Sense (CS)`** AKA **`Preamble Detect (PD)`:** <br><br>
    - **Purpose:** Detects and measures 802.11 encoded signals.
    - **Mechanism:** CS/PD detects and measures the 802.11 Preamble Header.
    - **Threshold:** If CS can "see" a Preamble Header & decode it (generally at -82 dBm), it will detect the channel as busy. <br><br>
2. **`Energy Detect (ED)`:** <br><br>
    - **Purpose:** Measures all RF energy around the antenna, including signals not recognized as 802.11.
    - **Mechanism:** ED detects any RF energy around the antenna.
    - **Threshold:** Detects a channel as busy if RF energy is greater than or equal to -62 dBm.

## ☁️📀 DCF: `Virtual Carrier Sense`
_Virtual Carrier Sense is a mechanism used in wireless networks to avoid collisions and ensure efficient use of the medium using information of the MAC Frame Headers: Duration Field & NAV_ 

Unlike Physical Carrier Sense, which relies on detecting actual transmissions at the physical layer, Virtual Carrier Sense uses information contained in the **MAC Frame Header** to predict future traffic on the medium. 

The two key components of Virtual Carrier Sense are:

1. **`Duration Field`** <br><br>
    - **Purpose**: Indicates the amount of time (in microseconds) that the channel will be occupied by the current frame exchange sequence. 
    - **Mechanism**: The Duration Field is included in the **Frame Control of the MAC header**. It specifies how long the transmitting station expects to use the medium, including any acknowledgment frames that may be sent in response. **The Duration Field indicated how much time on the medium is going to be requerid to transmit THE REST of the frames requiered in a 802.11 frame exchange. (eg. if it is a CTS frame the duration field will be THE REST of the exchange: 2 SIFS, Data Frame, 3 ACKs).**
    - **Usage**: Other stations in the network demodulate the 802.11 frame and **read the Duration Field in the MPDU** and update their **NAV Timer** accordingly to avoid transmitting during the specified period. The stations will update the timer until it reach 0, **when NAV = 0 then stations will try to comunicate _(but before stations need to complete IFS & Backoff timer processes)_. If a station can't demodulate the MPDU, then they will measure the medium using Physical Carrier Sense.** 
    - **Important**: **NAV is only updated when the Duration value is greater than the current NAV value.** <br><br>
2. **`Network Allocation Vector (NAV)`** <br><br>
    - **Purpose**: Acts as a timer that represents the period during which the medium is expected to be busy, based on the Duration Field values from received frames.
    - **Mechanism**: When a station receives a frame with a Duration Field, it sets its NAV timer to the value specified in the Duration Field if this value is greater than the current NAV value. This prevents the station from attempting to access the medium until the NAV timer expires.
    - **Impact**: The NAV helps manage medium access by providing a way for stations to reserve the medium for a certain period, reducing the likelihood of collisions.
    - **Important**: **While NAV is not equal to "0", stations presume that the medium is busy and will not transmit.**

**⭕ Duration Field Filter:**

- 🦈 **Duration Field = 0** :: NAV 0 : `wlan.duration == 0`
- 🦈 **Duration Field more than 0** :: NAV > 0 : `wlan.duration > 0`
  
**IMPORTANT:** In Wireshark (or any other protocol analyzer), the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) is not directly displayed as a single field because it is a conceptual timer maintained by each station based on the Duration Field found in the MAC header of 802.11 frames. However, you can infer the NAV by examining the Duration Field of the frames. By inspecting the Duration Field, you can understand the NAV that stations would use. The Duration Field value indicates how long the medium will be busy, and stations use this value to set their NAV timers. While Wireshark doesn't explicitly show the NAV, the Duration Field provides the necessary information to infer it.

**How Virtual Carrier Sense Works?**

- `Frame Transmission`: A station wishing to transmit sends a frame with a Duration Field indicating how long it will use the medium. <br><br>
- `NAV Update`: Other stations that receive this frame read the Duration Field and set their NAV timers accordingly if the Duration value is greater than their current NAV value. <br><br>
- `Medium Access`: These stations refrain from accessing the medium until their NAV timers expire, allowing the transmitting station to complete its transmission without interference.

## Virtual Carrier Sense Example Scenario:

1. # Station A wants to send data to Station B.
   # It calculates the total time needed for the transmission, including any necessary SIFS, Data & Acks.

2. # Station A sets the Duration Field in its frame to this calculated time and transmits the frame.

3. # Station C and Station D, which are within range, receive the frame from Station A.
   # They read the Duration Field and set their NAV timers to this value if it is greater than their current NAV value.

4. # Station C and Station D refrain from transmitting until their NAV timers expire,
   # allowing Station A to complete its transmission to Station B without collision.

### ⌛💹🔢 Duration Values

The Duration Field determine the **time in microseconds (μs)** needed to complete the Frame Exchange. This is measured **AFTER the current frame**, this means: what is left after the current frame.

There are 3 different main Duration Values types:

1. **Data Exchange** _(AKA RTS Data Exchange)_ = `SIFS + Ack`
2. **RTS/CTS Data Exchange** = `x3 SIFS + CTS + Data + ACK`
3. **CTS-to-Self Data Exchange** = `x2 SIFS + Data + ACK`

IMPORTANT:

- # CTS-to-Self is simply another method of performing NAV distribution & that use only CTS frames.

- # It is used strictly as protection mechanism for mixed mode environment.

- # The CTS-to-self NAV distribution mechanism is lower in network overhead cost than is the RTS/CTS NAV distribution mechanism,
  # but CTS-to-self is less robust against hidden nodes and collisions than RTS/CTS.

- # STAs employing a NAV distribution mechanism should choose a mechanism such as CTS-to-self or RTS/CTS that is appropriate
  # for the given network conditions.

- # If errors occur when employing the CTS-to-self mechanism, STAs should switch to a more robust mechanism.

## ⌛📏🏁 IFS (Interframe spaces)
_Interframe spaces are periods of time between frames; they are used to allow frames to be processed in a timely manner, avoid interference by ensuring frames are received, and prioritize transmission of certain frames. IFS is defined in the 802.11-2007 standard as: **“The time from the end of the last symbol of the previous frame to the beginning of the first symbol of the preamble of the subsequent frame as seen at the air interface.”**_

After each frame transmission 802.11 protocol require an idle period on the medium called Inter Frame Space (IFS): 

- IFS (Interframe spaces) is the time from the end of the last symbol of the previous frame to beginning og the first symbol of the preamble of the next frame in the air. 
- The interframe spacing timings are defined as time gaps on the medium.
- IFS unit of time is measured in microseconds (μs)  <br><br>
- The length of the IFS is depend on previous frame type, following frame type, access category, coordination function in use & PHY type as well. 
- All types of IFS has fixed time for each PHY except AIFS  
- IFS are needed for both: <br><br>
     - Keep buffer between the frames to avoid interference.
     - Add control and to prioritize frame transmissions.

---

### ⌛📏🔠 Types of IFS:

- There are multiple types of IFS, some defined by the original standard and others added to in 802.11e-2005 & 802.11n-2009.
- The type of IFS is dependent on the frame that will come after it.
- Using a shorter duration IFS gives certain frames priority over others, such as an ACK frame using short IFS (SIFS). <br> <br>

**First time transmission:**

- All IFS in a **QoS-BSS** are sent as **Arbitration IFS (AIFS)**. 
- BSS that do **not support QoS** will use the legacy **DCF IFS (DIFS)**.

---

### ⌛📏 `SIFS`: Short IFS

- Shortest IFS at 16 μs & 10 μs _prior to 802.11n (RIFS)_
- SIFS shall be used when STAs have seized the medium and need to keep it for the duration of the frame exchange sequence to be performed. Using the smallest gap between transmissions within the frame exchange sequence prevents other STAs, which are required to wait for the medium to be idle for a longer gap, from attempting to use the medium, thus giving priority to completion of the frame exchange sequence in progress.
- Frames specified to use SIFS will take priority over those using shorter IFS.

**⭕ Main Uses of SIFS:**

- This type is used for RTS/CTS and for positive Ack based high priority transmission.
- CTS frames sent as a response to RTS frames.
- Data frames sent immediately after a CTS frame.
- ACK frames sent immediately after receiving a data frame.

**⌛ Duration of SIFS:**

- 5GHz = `16 μs`
- 2.4GHz = `10 μs`

---

### ⌛📏 `RIFS`: Reduced IFS

- Shortest IFS at 2μs. _Even shorter than SIFS_
- RIFS were introduced with 802.11n for networks operating in Greenfield mode to improve efficiency for transmissions to the same receiver in which a SIFS-separated response is not required, such as a transmission burst (CFB-Contention Free Burst)
- 802.11n standard use RIFS & Block Acknowledgement (mandatory in 802.11n). RIFS is used only when Block ACK is enabled. When Block ACK are used, data frames of a CFB may send consecutively without interruption by ACK. At the end of CFB, Tx Station will simply send BAR (BlockACKRequest) & receiving a single Block Acknowledgement (BA).
- In actual 802.11n application RIFS is not used due to Aggregation with Block ACK getting more advantages.
- 802.11ac and later standards **do not use RIFS**.
- **RIFS is used specifically between frame transmissions by the same AP or station to improve efficiency in certain high-throughput scenarios.**

**⭕ Main Uses of RIFS:**

- For networks operating in Greenfield mode for burst transmissions (CFB-Contention Free Burst).

**⌛ Duration of RIFS:**

- 5GHz = `2 μs`
- 2.4GHz = `2 μs`

---

### ⌛📏 `EIFS`: Extended IFS

- Duration for EIFS needs a formula, for OFDM this equates to 160μs by default.
- Used in legacy DCF networks when a station is retransmitting (no ACK received) a frame that was previously corrupted due to collision or interference.
- The EIFS time is long enough to make sure the frame is realle lost and also gives chance to other sender to complete their backoff if it is in progress.
- EIFS is not used with A-MPDUs because the use of Block-ACK (Block-ACK already indicates about received and not received frames to the sender)

**⭕ Main Uses of EIFS:**

- All devices look for frames that have an incorrect frame check sequence (FCS), this is how they identify corrupt frames. When any AP or station hears a corrupt frame on their channel, they defer transmission for an EIFS to allow the frame to be retransmitted. 

**⌛ Duration of EIFS:**

- **EIFS** = SIFS + (8 * ACKsize) + Preamble Length + PLCP Header Length + DIFS 
- For OFDM, this equates to `160μs` by default. <br><br>
- **EIFS (in DCF)**  = SIFS + DIFS + ACK_Tx_Time
    - EIFS 802.11b/g/n devices using DSS = 364μS
    - EIFS 802.11g/n devices using OFDM = 160μS
    - EIFS 802.11a/n devices (5GHz)         = 160μS <br><br>
- **EIFS (in EDCA)**  = SIFS + AIFS[AC] + ACK_Tx_Time

**⚠️ Near/Far Problem in EIFS:**

- Due to side effect of EIFS, stations near to AP could cause problem to stations at Far(hence called Near/Far problem).
- When data send between AP & near by stations, they can use high data rates where far stations cannot be demodulate & interpret as corrupted frame. So far stations stay quiet for EIFS, while the near station will be allowed to use DIFS or AIFS.
- The use of DIFS will give nearby station higher priority & get more opportunity to transmit while far station remain quiet.

---

### ⌛📏 `PIFS`: PCF IFS _(not implemented)_

- PIFS has different durations depending on band and short/long slot time. 
- PIFS is used in CFP (Contention Free Periods) in PCF mode. But PCF was not implemented in actual 802.11 Wi-Fi application so **there is no use for PIFS**.
- Because PCF has not been implemented in 802.11 devices, you will not see PIFS used for this purpose. In order to gain priority over other STAs during contention, the AP can transmit a Channel Switch Announcement (802.11h) frame after observing a PIFS

**⭕ Main Uses of EIFS:**

- PIFS is used in Channel Switch Announcement Frame (802.11h) scenario to gain access to the medium priority (As PIFS is shorter than DIFS).
- PIFS is also used for stations (STAs) operating under PCF to gain priority access of the medium at the start of CFP (contention free period).

**⌛ Duration of PIFS:**

- PIFS = `SIFS + Slot Time`

---

### ⌛📏 `DIFS`: Distributed IFS _(for Non QoS)_

- Duration is SIFS + 2 slot times (The duration of a DIFS is longer than both the SIFS and PIFS.).
- **For `NON QoS` frames** :: first time transmission within a DCF network

**⭕ Main Uses of DIFS:**

- When a STA desires to transmit a data frame (MPDU) or management frame (MMPDU) for the first time within a DCF network, the duration of a DIFS must be observed after the previous frame’s completion. 

**⌛ Duration of DIFS:**

- SIFS + 2 slot times: <br><br>
    - SlotTime :: 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz : DSS ) = `20μS` <br><br>
    - SlotTime :: 802.11g/n (2.4 GHz : HT or ERP) = `20μS` with **long preamble**
    - SlotTime :: 802.11g/n (2.4 GHz : HT or ERP) = `9μS`  with **short preamble** <br><br>
    - SlotTime :: 802.11a/n/ac (5 GHz) = `9μS`

---

### ⌛📏 `AIFS`: Arbitration IFS _(for QoS)_

- Duration is SIFS + 2 slot times (The duration of a DIFS is longer than both the SIFS and PIFS.).
- **For `QoS` frames** :: first time transmission within a DCF network

**⭕ Main Uses of AIFS:**

- The AIFS shall be used by QoS STAs to transmit **all data frames (MPDUs)**, **all management frames (MMPDUs)**, and the following control frames: **PS-Poll**, **RTS**, **CTS (when not transmitted as a response to the RTS)**, **BlockAckReq**, and **BlockAck (when not transmitted as a response to the BlockAckReq)**.

**⚠️ Arbitration Inter Frame Space Number (AIFSN) in AIFS:**

- The number of slot times used in the AIFS is called the Arbitration Inter Frame Space Number (AIFSN).
- 802.11e specifies 4 access categories (AV_VO : Voice, AC_VI : Video, AC_BE : Best Effort & AC_BK : Background). <br><br>
    - **Voice & Video = `2 slottimes` by default**
    - **Best Effort = `3 slottimes` by default**
    - **Background = `7 slottimes` by default**

**⌛ Duration of AIFS:**

- AIFS[AC] = `AIFSN[AC] × SlotTime + SIFSTime`

### cfb

`CFB (Contention-Free Burst)`: CFB refers to a burst of frames sent during a contention-free period, often associated with legacy 802.11 protocols.

### Radar DCF
_Radar will affect the 5 GHz band on channels 120, 124 and 128. Using WLAN integration allows the analyst to easily identify the channels that are used with 802.11 and will help to identify radar that may impact the WLAN._

###👨🏻‍⚖️🚦 Network Arbitration: `Arbitration Methods`




- `Slot Time`: The slot time is a set value based on the PHY technology in use. This time is either 9us or 20us. For example OFDM used with 802.11a has a slot time of 9us. This value is used in conjunction with the random number chosen from the contention window to count down and determine if the medium is clear prior to a STA transmitting a single frame.


- `EDCA`: EDCA is an access method under Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) and assigns user priorities based on the type of traffic sent. There are eight user priorities (0-7) that map to four different access categories AC-VO (voice) AC-VI (video) AC-BE (best effort) and AC-BK (background).




























































# 🛜🔋🛑 MAC Operations: `Power Management` & `Protection Mechanisms`
_There are 2 types of MAC Operations: Power Management & Protection Mechanisms | Power Management is allow the radio to go to sleep (just few microseconds), because if the antenna/adapter keeps awake all the time is consuming battery all the time, in a movile device can degrade battery life. Power management it's just turning on the antenna, send/recieve the frame, turn off the antenna and so on. The hint here is, that the STA does not lose any frame even if it's sleeping | Protection Mechanisms allow newer devices to communicate and "exist" in a world where older devices also exists_

## 🔋🛜🪫 MAC Operations: `Power Management`
_Many mechanisms that are described in the IEEE 802.11 standard allow a wireless device to reduce its power consumption, to turn off its radios and to wake up at the correct time to retrieve its traffic. While the APs are generally connected to an external power source, the wireless clients are often running on batteries. The purpose of power saving features is to increase the battery life and to allow longer performance. This battery life extension can be significant for low-powered devices such as smartphones, Voice over IP phones or handheld barcodes scanners._

### 🔋⚡🪫 Power Consumption Activities

A wireless radio can perform one of the 4 activities. Power consumed by each activity increases in the given order (1-4). In power save mode, the client STA would set the power management flag to `1` to indicate it might go into the **Doze state to save power**, otherwise the client STA would set the power management flag to `0` to indicate that the station is **NOT in power save mode.**

### 🔋🐓💤 Power States
_A wireless client STA enters Power Save (PS) mode in which the radio power state can transition between awake and doze according to the 802.11 power management rules. A radio STA can be in one of two Power states:_

- 🐓 **`Awake`**: The client STA radio is constantly powered and able to receive and transmit. <br> <br>
- 💤 **`Doze`**: The client STA cannot receive or transmit any frames and operates in a very low power state to conserve power. STA is allowed to go to "Doze" state after an AP has been notified that station is about to enter Power Save (PS) mode. STA will use `Null Data Frame` or `QoS Null Data Frame` with bit `Power Management / Power Save Mode = 1` to inform the AP that it will going to "Doze" state.

STA will go from `Doze` to `Awake` state for one of two reasons: 

1. If STA have a frame to send.
2. Based on the STA internal timing mechanism. <br> <br>
    - 🦈🐓 Data & Power Management = 0 ==>> **Awake** :: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 36 && wlan.fc.pwrmgt == 0`
    - 🦈🐓 QoS Data & Power Management = 0 ==>> **Awake** :: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 44 && wlan.fc.pwrmgt == 0` <br> <br>
    - 🦈💤 Data & Power Management = 1 ==>> **Doze** :: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 36 && wlan.fc.pwrmgt == 1`
    - 🦈💤 QoS Data & Power Management = 1 ==>> **Doze** :: `wlan.fc.type_subtype == 44 && wlan.fc.pwrmgt == 1`

### 🔋⚙️🔀 Power Management: `Modes`
_A client STA can be in one of two Power Management modes:_

- ⭕🐓 **`Active mode`**: the client is awake all the time. The AP immediately transmits the frames to the client. <br> <br>
- ⭕💤 **`Power Save (PS) mode`**: the client is mostly in doze power state, but can also be awake to transmit and receive now and then. In this mode, the AP buffers the eligible frames destined for the client.

---

### 🪪🆔🤳 PS Field: `AID (Association Identifier)`

- ⭕ AID (Association Identifier): **Sent by the AP** (`Association Response` or `Re-Association Response`) :: Every 802.11 Power Management Method starts begin with the client STA associates to the BSS. When AP sends "Association Response" or "Re-Association Response" frame to the STA, an `AID` value is present in the AID parameter field (16-bit). <br> <br>
    - 🦈 Filter :: AID (Association Identifier) 3 = `wlan.fixed.aid == 3` 

---

### 👂⏳🐓 PS Field: `Listen Interval`

- Listen Interval: **Sent by the STA** (`Association Request` or `Re-Association Request`) :: The client STA will go to `awake` state in a timing period called "Listen Interval". The "Association Request" or "Re-Association Request" frame includes a Listen Interval subfield within the Capabilities Information field. It is an integer between 0 and 65535 expressed in **units of Beacon Interval** (ex. 250 = Listen every 250 beacons). It indicates to the AP how often a client in PS mode wakes up to listen to the Beacon frames. In the AP, the Aging Time of the buffered frames bound to the client is implemented differently by each vendor but must not be shorter than the Listen Interval (or the WNM Sleep Interval in a WNM Sleep Mode Request frame). The Listen Interval from the client is also vendor specific // In other words, **this is an unicast frame used for power management purposes sent from the STA to the AP, this value informs the AP of how many Beacons the STA will be dozing when in a power save state.** For example if a STA has a listen interval of 15 that means it will doze for 15 Beacons and if the Beacon interval is 100 time units the STA will doze for approximately 1.5 seconds.<br> <br>

    - 🦈 Filter :: Listen Interval 250 (HEX) = `wlan.fixed.listen_ival == 0x00fa`
    - 🦈 Filter :: Listen Interval 250 (Decimal) = `wlan.fixed.listen_ival == 250`

### 📫📩📬 PS Information Element: `TIM (Traffic Indication Map)`

`TIM (Traffic Indication Map)`: It's a IE (Information Element) present **only in `Beacon` frames** with the two following Sub-Fields: 

- ⭕ Element ID (1 byte / 8 bits): Value of 5 indicates is a TIM. <br> <br>
    - 🦈 Element ID = 5 :: `wlan.tag.number == 5` <br> <br>

    - 🦈 Tag Lenght = 4 :: `wlan.tag.length == 4` <br> <br>
- ⭕ DTIM (Delivery-TIM) Count (1 byte / 8 bits): Incremental `Beacon Frames` until the next DTIM. <br> <br>
    - 🦈 DTIM = 0 ==>> **Beacon is a DTIM** :: `wlan.tim.dtim_count == 0`
    - 🦈 DTIM = 1 ==>> **1 Beacon left until next DTIM** :: `wlan.tim.dtim_count == 1`
    - 🦈 DTIM = 2 ==>> **2 Beacons left until next DTIM** :: `wlan.tim.dtim_count == 2` <br> <br>
- ⭕ DTIM (Delivery-TIM) Period (1 byte / 8 bits): Number of `Beacon Frames` between DTIM beacon. <br> <br>
    - 🦈 DTIM period = 1 ==>> **Every beacon will be a DTIM** _(ex. Ruckus_default_SSID)_ :: `wlan.tim.dtim_period == 1`
    - 🦈 DTIM period = 3 ==>> **Every 2nd beacon will be a DTIM** _(ex. Fz3r0_CWAP_SSID)_ :: `wlan.tim.dtim_period == 2`
    - 🦈 DTIM period = 3 ==>> **Every 3rd beacon will be a DTIM** _(ex. Muegahouse_SSID)_ :: `wlan.tim.dtim_period == 3` <br> <br>
- ⭕ Bitmap Control (1 byte / 8 bits): Indicates if **Multicast/Broadcast** traffic are buffered at the AP (true or false) & also uses a space save called `Bitmap Offset` which may have a value between 0 - 127. <br> <br>
    - 🦈 Bitmap Control = 1 ==>> **There's a multicast/broadcast frame buffering for any STA** :: `wlan.tim.bmapctl.multicast == 1`
    - 🦈 Bitmap Control = 0 ==>> **No multicast/broadcast frames are buffering** :: `wlan.tim.bmapctl.multicast == 0` <br> <br>
    - 🦈 Bitmap Offset = 0 ==>> **how many bytes are Zero in Partial Virtual Bitmap (PVB)** :: `wlan.tim.bmapctl.offset == 0`
    - 🦈 Bitmap Offset > 0 ==>> **how many bytes are Zero in Partial Virtual Bitmap (PVB)** `wlan.tim.bmapctl.offset > 0` <br> <br>
- ⭕ PVB (Partial Virtual Map): (1 byte - 251 bytes): Series of flags indicating whether each associated STA has **Unicast** frames buffered at the AP. Each bit in this field corresponds to an AID of a STA. <br> <br>
    - 🦈 PVB = 0 ==>> **No unicast frames are buffered** :: `wlan.tim.partial_virtual_bitmap == 00` 
    - 🦈 PVB more than 0 ==>> **Unicast frames are buffered** :: `wlan.tim.partial_virtual_bitmap > 00`

⚠️ **`IMPORTANT`**: **The minimum value of the Length field of the Traffic Indication Map (TIM) information element is 4**. This value includes the length of the **Partial Virtual Bitmap**, which is at least one octet, along with the other **required fields (DTIM Count, DTIM Period, and Bitmap Control)**.

### 🚨📩📬 PS Information Element: `DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Map)`

`DTIM (Delivery Traffic Indication Map)`: **Sent by the AP** (`Beacon`) _(DTIM is not present in all beacons or all TIMs inside a becon)_ :: DTIM is a Information Element inside a TIM carried by a beacon frame (identical in structure to any other Beacon Frame). The only difference with a common Beacon Frame is that the content of the DTIM IE (Information Element) will give information about broadcast/multicast traffic that is buffered at the AP, in addition to the typical information about buffered unicast frames that is always present in the TIM. <br> <br>

- ⭕ DTIM Count = 0: means that the current TIM (beacon) frame is a DTIM
- ⭕ DTIM Count = 1: means 1 Beacon left until next DTIM
- ⭕ DTIM Count = 2: means 2 Beacons left until next DTIM <br> <br>
- ⭕ DTIM Delivery Period = 3: means every 3rd frame a beacon will be a DTIM
- ⭕ DTIM Delivery Period = 2: means every 2nd frame a beacon will be a DTIM
- ⭕ DTIM Delivery Period = 1: All the beacons will be a DTIM <br> <br>
- ⭕ DTIM Bitmap Control = 1: There's a multicast/broadcast frame buffering in the AP for any STA
- ⭕ DTIM Bitmap Control = 0: No multicast/broadcast frame buffering in the AP for any STA

### Control Frame: `PS-Poll`

PS-POLL: The legacy PS mode mechanism is based on the PS-Poll frame to retrieve the buffered frames in the AP. The PS-Poll frame is a short Control Frame containing the AID value of the client. PS-Poll have the following Sub-Fields:
- Type `01` (Control Frame) :: Subtype `1010` (PS-Poll)
    - AID (Association ID) : AID of the STA requesting buffered frames
    - BSSID : BSSID where the STA is associated
    - Transmitter : MAC of the STA requesting buffered frames




## Power Management: `Types`
_From the original version in 1997 to now, many features that reduce power consumption have been added to the standard. Some of them have fallen into disuse (PS-Poll), some have been granted certifications (WMM-Power Save) and others relate to specific technologies (MIMO PSPM, 11ac VHT TXOP PS). And there are many other mechanisms related to power-saving that are not discussed in this article (PSMP, TIM Broadcast, Proxy ARP, etc.). Future amendments (802.11ax, 802.11ah) will also introduce new and enhanced power saving techniques._

- 802.11–1997 prime Power Management: 802.11 Power Management (Legacy Power Save Mode)
- 802.11e-2005 Power Management: Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) using Automatic Power Save Delivery (APSD) (Scheduled & Unscheduled (S-APSD / U-APSD)). U-APSD is the main Power Save used in 802.11e.
- 802.11n-2009 Power Management: Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP) & _Spatial Multiplexing Power Save (SMPS)_ 
- 802.11ac-2013 Power Management: VHT TXOP (Transmit Opportunity) Power Save
- 802.11ax-2019 Power Management: Target Wake Time (TWT)

## 802.11 Power Save (Legacy power save mode)

- Less Efficient Power Save Mode.
- There are 2 Types of Legacy Power Save Mode _(Clients can support either one of the two legacy power save mechanisms at one time)_: <br><br>
1. **Power save Poll: `PS Poll**
2. **Non Power save Poll: `Non PS Poll`** 

---

### 802.11 Power Save (Legacy power save mode): `PS-Poll Mode`:

- As the name suggests `PS-Poll` stands for `Power Save Polling`.
- In this mode the client STA uses `PS-Poll`, this is a control frame the STA sends to an AP after receiving a beacon containing the STAs association ID (AID) in the TIM. The STA will send PS-Poll frames to the AP until it receives a frame from the AP with the `More Data bit set to 0`. A STA may not go back to sleep until its AID is clear from the TIM whereas APs may choose to delay response to the PS-Poll frame; this is vendor specific.
- The Access point uses the TIM information element to indicate to the station that there is unicast data buffered for the WLAN client STA to the AP.
- In PS Poll mode, the device may wake up at intervals to check for incoming data or to initiate data transmission, which can result in lower power consumption compared to the Non PS Poll mode.

### 802.11 Power Save (Legacy power save mode): `Non PS-Poll Mode`:

- The `Non PS Poll` mechanism refers to situations where a device **does not use the PS Poll mechanism** to wake up from its power saving mode and instead relies on other mechanisms to wake up and communicate with the AP.
- In this mode the client simply exits the PS mode and switches back to active mode. `Null Data` frames or `QoS Null Data` frames are generally used for this purpose.
- The device may wake up more frequently to check for incoming data or to initiate data transmission, which can result in higher power consumption compared to the PS Poll mode. However, it provides more flexibility and responsiveness for the device to communicate when needed.

1. The **client STA** sends an `association request` to the AP, indicating it wants to associate and providing its `Listen Interval` value (e.g., **Listen Interval = 250**). The Listen Interval tells the AP how often the STA will wake up to listen to beacons., ex. a Listen Interval of 250 means that the STA will wake up every 250th beacon). AP uses the Listen Interval to determine the lifetime of buffered frames. // Then, **the AP acknowledges the reception of the association request** from the client STA by sending an `ACK` (acknowledgment) frame. <br><br>
    - 🦈 Listen Interval of 250 :: `wlan.fixed.listen_ival == 250` <br><br>
2. The **AP** responds with an `association response` frame, which includes the `Association ID (AID)` assigned to the client STA (e.g., **AID = 5**). // Then, the **client STA acknowledges the association response** from the AP by sending an ACK frame back to the AP. <br><br>

## 802.11e
_The 802.11e standard is being designed to be backward compatible with the legacy 802.11 standard, which implies that DCF and PCF mode stations can work without restrictions in the new QoS enable environment. In fact, the traffic of a station working in DCF mode is treated as traffic belonging to AC1 of the new EDCA mode with TXOP equal to zero. Hence, from DCF point of view this coexistence is quite fair as DCF is a Best Effort traffic oriented. On the other hand, PCF mode stations in the new standard are managed by HC as if it were PC, which provides schedule for them. Therefore, there is hardly any change in system behaviour.     However, from 802.11e standpoint the introduction of legacy 802.11 stations in a QBSS system pose a risk to the QoS guarantees. Direct cooperation of both types of stations without any restriction on the legacy 802.11 traffic will penalize all QoS guarantees provided by standalone IEEE 802.11e network [3][4] due to previously mentioned 802.11 limitations. Therefore, to be able to provide real QoS support in wireless LAN with coexistence of 802.11 and 802.11e stations it will be necessary to consider some QoS mechanism for legacy stations._


## 802.11e-2005: `WMM` & `U-APSD`
_802.11e introduced **Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM)** and also introduced Automatic Power Save Delivery (APSD) in two varieties, scheduled and unscheduled. **Unscheduled (U-APSD)** gets all the attention, it is the method that **WMM-PS** is based on | scheduled (S-APSD) is not in the objectives of either the CWNA or CWAP exam | The goal of APSD is to be more efficient than the PS-Poll method used previously. This is accomplished by replacing PS-Poll frames with **trigger frames**. The trigger frame can be ANY data frame; this increases the efficiency of the entire BSS by avoiding the use of the PS-Poll control frame altogether. || Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) uses different and more efficient ways for power save mode for client device (STA’s) than the original power save mode that introduced with the 802.11 standard also known as legacy power save mode. U-APSD (Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery) uses what is known as a trigger and delivery method for devices that are enabled for power save. With this method a client device will only doze when not sending or receiving frames. The trigger frame is an event that will inform the client device not to doze until it has received the buffered frames. This eliminates the PS-Poll frame that is used with legacy power save mode._

**WMM (U-APSD) power save mode uses `Trigger` to wake and transmit or receive frames** - This is accomplished by replacing PS-Poll frames with **trigger frames**. The trigger frame can be ANY data frame; this increases the efficiency of the entire BSS by avoiding the use of the PS-Poll control frame altogether._


## Offchannel Scanning


## IBSS Power Management
_In an IBSS configuration, no full-time AP exists and all systems may desire to enter sleep mode, the problem is there is no AP to send TIM or DTIM.  So in IBSS, **Announcement Traffic Indication Message (ATIM)** is use for power management._

- In IBSS (ad hoc network) there is no AP to send TIM or DTIM. So if a STA goes into power save mode multiple other STAs has to buffer its data for specific STA.
- So in IBSS, Announcement Traffic Indication Message (ATIM) is use for power management.
- ATIM is a management frame with no frame body.
- When a STA receives ATIM, that formally dozing station must begin the process of retrieving buffered frame from the stations that transmitted the ATIM.




















## 🔋🛜🪫 MAC Operations: `802.11 Power Management`
_`PS Mode` or 802.11 Power Save is a mechanism that allow STA to wake up at various intervals and use a **PS-Poll** frame to indicate to the AP that is awake & ready to recieve frames | Power save methods allow battery-operated devices to save power by shutting down their wireless radios. | Power Management mode shall not change during any single frame exchange sequence. This means the Power Management bit is the same for all MPDUs in an A-MPDU | `Listen Interval` is just How often STA wakes up & listen beacons measured in units of Beacon Interval & Determines lifetime of buffered frames in an AP | `TIM` are Present only within beacon frames generated by APs, TIM element contains information useful for stations in low-power mode. The AP uses Delivery Traffic Indication Map (DTIM) to inform the cell if it has broadcast or multicast frames buffered. |  While devices are in a sleep state, the AP buffers frames destined for it. The legacy power management methods were defined in the original 802.11 standard; however, major improvements have been added in both 802.11e-2005 and 802.11n-2009 amendments. There are also mentions of power save enhancements in both 802.11ac-2013 and 802.11ax-2018 amendments._











### Legacy power save mode
- PS-Poll frames are used with legacy power save mode. All STA’s receive an Association ID (AID) during the 802.11 association process. When a STA wakes from a doze state based on the listen interval it will check the traffic indication map (TIM) in a Beacon management frame. If there is unicast traffic buffered the STA will send a PS-Poll frame to receive the buffered data.




### 802.11n-2009









````py
## Basic Structure of 802.11 Power Management:

1. Before a STA goes into the doze state, it sends a frame, usually null data frame, to the AP indicating that power management is enabled.
2. Once STA indicate, that it is in Power Save mode, the AP begins to buffer all frames destined to that station.
3. When the station goes into awake state, it sends a frame to the AP in order to begin the data retrieval process.
4. When AP has finished sending all buffered data to the station, the station goes back into the doze state.

## Basic/Legacy Standard: 

STA :: Send a PS-Poll PWR Mgmt bit = 1 to indicate to AP that will STA is going to sleep. ➡️
(STA sleeping... & AP is buffering frames for it) 
(STA wakes up... & check for beacons frames TIMs (Traffic Indication Map) & check if the STA "Association ID" is included in the TIM
STA :: If Association ID is in the TIM, then STA send a PS-Poll PWR Mgmt bit = 0 to indicate to AP that STA is wake up ➡️
AP :: AP ACK the PS-Poll ➡️
AP :: AP sends Data to the STA and if there's more thata will send a "more data" bit = 1 indicating there's more data ➡️
STA :: STA ACK the More Data = 1 ➡️
STA send a PS-Poll PWR Mgmt bit = 0 to indicate to AP that STA still wake up 
AP :: AP ACK the PS-Poll ➡️
AP :: AP sends Data to the STA and if there's more thata will send a "more data" bit = 1 indicating there's more data ➡️
.
.
.
AP :: AP ACK the PS-Poll ➡️
AP :: AP sends Data to the STA and if there's NO MORE data te send, it will send the "more data" bit = 0 indicating there's no more data ➡️
STA :: STA ACK the More Data = 0 ➡️
STA :: Send a PS-Poll PWR Mgmt bit = 1 to indicate to AP that will STA is going to sleep. ➡️
(STA sleeping... & AP is buffering frames for it)

## 📡📻🛰️ `RF`: Radio Frequency
_Oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around 20 kHz to around 300 GHz (This is roughly between the upper limit of audio frequencies and the lower limit of infrared frequencies) || These are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as radio waves, so they are used in radio technology & telecomunicatios || In wireless electronics & comunications: Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with identified radio frequencies that range from 3kHz to 300 GHz. Frequency refers to the rate of oscillation (of the radio waves.) || RF propagation occurs at the speed of light and does not need a medium like air in order to travel. This means that radio waves (RF) can propagate through a vacuum and do not require a physical medium, such as air, to travel. In other words, while it is true that radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that can propagate through the air, it is also true that they do not need air or any other material medium for their propagation. Unlike sound, which requires a material medium (such as air, water, or a solid) to travel, radio waves can propagate in the vacuum of space, this is why radio waves could travel through space virtually indefinitely, as they encounter no significant resistance that dissipates them._

# 802.11 Wi-Fi: `Modulation`
_Modulation is important in the physical layer 1 (PHY) because it allows the transmission of information through physical communication mediums such as cables or radio signals (RF). | Modulation also helps improve the efficiency and speed of data transmission by enabling the transmission of a large amount of information on a single carrier wave. | Modulation is used to transmit data from one device to another by modifying a carrier wave, which can be an electrical or electromagnetic signal. | Information is modulated onto the carrier wave by varying some physical property of the wave, such as its amplitude, frequency, or phase._

## RF Modulation
_Modulation in Wi-Fi is the process of converting digital signals 1 & 0 into RF_ 
_`Analog` - Sun, light, sounds, colors | Smooth & Continious (no "steps") | Noise Amplification_ <br>
_`Digital` - 1 & 0 | Discrete Steps (a lot! no infinite tho) | Digital Signal = Pulse Wave | Original Regen_
- [Why do we need modulation during transmission?](https://youtu.be/dvGcCk1vbjk) _@ Sunny_
- [`Analog` vs `Digital`](https://youtu.be/gGxpUZ_iuYA) _@ Sunny_ <br>

## RF Modulation: `AM` & `FM`
_`AM` - lower Freq = larger = far transmission, news channels, more noise (due amplitude moves)_ <br>
_`FM` - high Freq = smaller = more data, less distance, music, less noise no-static (static amplitude)_
- [`AM` vs `FM` Modulations - **(Analog Modulation)**](https://youtu.be/I0jdIvwkiDI) _@ Sunny_ <br>


## Multiplexing
_`TDM` - Time Division Multiplexing | dividing time into slots/intervals | **equally** assignment | old_ <br>
_`STDM` - Statistical Time division Multiplexing | Analyzes stats: workload/priority & determines time will take_ <br>
_`FDM` - Frequency Division Multiplexing | Different (analog signals) | same time on no overlapping chan_ <br>
_`Baseband TDM` - Transmit 1 signal at time 1&0 | ej. **`Wired / Ethernet`** | `TDM` & `STDM`_ <br>
_`Broadband FDM` - Multi-transmit, share 1 channel at diff Freqs | ej. **`RF`**,  **`HSIA`**, **`DSL`** | `FDM`_
- [`Multiplexing:` TDM, Statistical TDM & FDM | Multiple Signals Combined Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIZhDl35_XY)  _@ Sunny_ <br>

## Modulation Methods
_Modulation is a process by which some property of a carrier signal is modified to represent digital bits. Amplitude, frequency, and phase are the three basic elements of a waveform that can be varied. | Complex Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) are used in 802.11 WLANs. There are various types of modulation used in 802.11 WLANs including DBPSK, DQPSK, and QAM. | There are various types of coding schemes as well, including Barker, CCK, PBCC, and FEC (convolutional)._

## WiFi Timing

### Preamble & Training Fields
_In 802.11/WiFi, timing is carried out using Preamble & Training Fields. The Preamble is a sequence of bits used to synchronize the receiver device's clock with the transmitter device's clock. This helps ensure that data bits are transmitted at the correct timing and interpreted correctly at the receiver end. The Training Fields are a series of bits used to adjust the transmission signal at the receiver. This includes compensating for signal attenuation and removing interference or noise in the transmission signal. The Training Fields also aid the receiver in detecting transmission errors and making corrections if necessary._

### Timing Synchonization
_In a WiFi transmission, the receiver must be synchronized with the transmitter. "Time Synchronization" refers to the process of synchronizing the clock between wireless devices within a Wi-Fi network.
Time synchronization is essential in Wi-Fi networks to ensure reliable and error-free data transmission. When devices are synchronized in time, it ensures that data packets are transmitted and received at the right moment, and prevents devices from transmitting on the same channel and at the same time, which could lead to collisions and errors in data transmission. In Wi-Fi networks, time synchronization is performed using a protocol called Wi-Fi Time Synchronization Protocol - WTS. This protocol allows wireless devices to synchronize their clocks and establish a common time interval for the transmission and reception of data packets._

## 🦈🐽🔎 `Protocol Analysers` & `Sniffers`
_A protocol analyzer and a sniffer are software tools used to analyze and monitor/capture network traffic. Although they are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference between them._

- ⭕ **`Sniffer`**: Focuses on capturing and analyzing network packets in real time. <br> <br>
- ⭕ **`Protocol Analyzer`**: In contrast, a protocol analyzer is used to analyze network traffic that has been previously captured. In other words, a protocol analyzer is used to analyze and study network packets that have already been captured and stored. <br><br>
    - `Note`: Today most of the tools like Wireshark work as both: Sniffer and Protocol Analyzer at same time

## ➰🦈🎣 Protocol Analysis: `Capturing 802.3 Freames`
_Ethernet 802.3 captures involve the examination of data packets from Layer 2 (Data Link) to the upper layers (3-7) of the OSI model. This process is crucial for understanding network traffic, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring efficient network performance. Various methods exist to capture this traffic, each with its advantages and limitations._

## ➰👂➰ Capturing Ethernet 802.3 Freames: Taffic Access Methods
_Capturing Ethernet 802.3 frames can be achieved through several methods, each with its specific use cases and limitations_

## 📡🦈🎣 Protocol Analysis: `Capturing 802.11 Frames`
_Capturing and analyzing traffic on 802.3 Ethernet networks is simpler compared to 802.11 WiFi networks, which are more complex and require additional tools and skills. Capturing frames in WiFi networks is inherently more challenging than in wired Ethernet networks due to the wireless nature and associated technical difficulties. Therefore, having the right skills and tools is essential for accurate 802.11 frame capture and analysis._ _

### ❗📢🚩 Key notes on captureing 802.11 Frames

_When dealing with WiFi networks, several factors need to be considered:_
- Capture all types of 802.11 frames, not just management or data frames.
- Choose the right hardware and software tools, including compatible drivers, monitor mode support and operating systems.
- Select the appropriate band and channel using tools like spectrum analyzers and monitoring tools.
- Synchronize the capture device’s clock to avoid desynchronization.


## 🛜🥷🏻🩺 Adapter Modes: `Monitor Mode` & `Promiscous Mode`
_It is important to understand that Monitor Mode and Promiscuous Mode are different concepts. For Ethernet capture, only Promiscuous Mode is needed. However, capturing WiFi traffic is more complex and requires both Monitor Mode and Promiscuous Mode._

### 🥷🏻🩺 Adapter Modes: `Promiscous Mode`

- ⭕ Promiscuous mode in a Sniffer is a feature that allows a user to see and capture all packets in the network, regardless of their destination, rather than just those addressed to their network adapter.This mode should always be enabled when capturing frames, whether Ethernet or Wi-Fi. This means that in Promiscuous Mode, packets not intended for your device can be captured, which is useful for network analysis. <br> <br>
- ⭕ Promiscuous Mode lets an interface or network adapter "listen" to all traffic passing through, even if it's not specifically addressed to that device or belongs to a different subnet or VLAN. As long as there is traffic on the interface, it can be captured. <br> <br>
    - ❗ **IMPORTANT**: Promiscuous Mode cannot capture unicast traffic between two devices that are not the device in promiscuous mode because this traffic is transmitted through other interfaces and it's not seen in the interface that our device is using, either via a switch or directly peer-to-peer (This can only be achieved with devices "In-The-Middle" like a Network Tap).  <br> <br>
- ➰ `Promiscous Mode for 802.3 Ethernet`: Simply connect the Ethernet cable to the interface, enable Promiscuous Mode, and you can start capturing traffic. <br> <br>
- 🛜 `Promiscous Mode for 802.11 Wi-Fi`: It's more complex; besides enabling Promiscuous Mode, additional hardware tools are needed, and drivers must be configured for **Monitor Mode**. The operating system, hardware (Wi-Fi adapters), and software (protocol analyzers and sniffers) must support **Monitor Mode**.

### 🛜🩺 Adapter Modes: `Monitor Mode`

- ⭕ Monitor Mode is a special mode where a wireless network adapter is configured to capture all wireless network traffic, including packets addressed to MAC addresses other than the adapter itself. This is similar to Promiscuous Mode but for wireless networks, and Promiscuous Mode is still required. <br> <br>
- ⭕ In Monitor Mode, the wireless network adapter captures all packets on the wireless network (RF/air medium), regardless of their destination. This is useful for analyzing all wireless network traffic, including traffic not directed to your device. <br> <br>
- ⭕ To capture all frames on a wireless network, you need a Wi-Fi 802.11 network adapter in Monitor Mode (not all the Wi-Fi adapters support this mode). To capture all packets on a wired Ethernet 802.3 network, use a wired network adapter in Promiscuous Mode. For capturing traffic on a mixed wireless and wired network, both a wireless adapter in Monitor Mode and a wired adapter in Promiscuous Mode are needed. <br> <br>
- ⭕ Wi-Fi traffic in the air can be captured by anyone within range with the right tools, highlighting the importance of encryption and other security measures. <br> <br>
    - ❗ **IMPORTANT**: On Apple macOS, you can put Wireshark in Monitor Mode without needing an additional USB adapter and drivers (this is because Wi-Fi adapter on macOS support monitor mode), unlike on Windows (default Windows adapters does not support monitor mode). In Linux, it depends on the adapter, distribution, drivers, updates, and other variables. <br> <br>
    - ❗ **IMPORTANT**: If you capture in USB 2.0 mode some frame may lose, and if you capture in UDB 3.0 mode you must be aware that some frames may be end being corrupted because you don't have enough SNR, USB 3.0 interference may increase your noise floor from 3 db's to 20 db's. So you need to choose the right adapter and the right USB hub to keep a max of 5 or 6 db's of noise floor increase to have the oportunity of demulate most of the captured frames.



## 🩺📟⚙️ Monitor Mode: `Drivers` & `Chipsets`
_Selecting the right drivers and chipsets for capturing 802.11 frames in monitor mode is crucial for effective wireless network analysis. Not all Wi-Fi adapters support monitor mode, and the ability to capture all types of frames (management, control, and data) depends heavily on the hardware and its drivers._

## 🛜🪤🎣 Frame Capture: `802.11 Frame Capture Devices & Methods`
_Devices and methods for capturing 802.11 WiFi frames can be categorized into three main types. At the end, it mostly depends on the resources and needs_

| **Capture Method**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                               | **Pros**                                                                                       | **Cons**                                                                                          | **Accessibility and Cost**                                                                       | **Examples**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mobile Capture**        | Uses mobile devices like laptops with Linux and USB Wi-Fi adapters that support "monitor mode" to capture traffic.                                                                          | Portable and flexible, relatively low cost, no specialized hardware needed                    | Limited range and capacity, requires extensive setup and configuration, potential driver issues  | Most accessible, can be cost-effective, range from simple setups (e.g., Raspberry Pi) to complex systems with high-end computers   | Linux with adapters like Alfa and tools like airmon, macOS internal adapter, devices like Wi-Pi, WiFi Pineapple, Wi-Spy |

## 🎛️⚙️ Frame Capture: `Capture Options`
_When capturing network traffic, setting appropriate capture options ensures you collect the most relevant data efficiently. Key capture options include:_

- 🎛️ **`Capture Title`**: Always name your captures with much details as possible like where, when, why (ex. 2024-06-06_13-25hrs_802-11_AP-Room-1_Authentication_iphone-f0-f0-f0-f0-f0-f0_-_01.pcap) <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Continious Capture`**: Recycle the capture buffer, which is a temporary buffer where the captured packets are stored. 
 (Buffer becomes a FIFO buffer) (ex. each 10mb of capture the buffer will reset). <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Save to Disk`**: Save all packets to disk, specify the name, size and save/stop criteria (ex. Set Title + 512mb file size + Stop After 2048mb captured + Keep Most Recent 3 files + New File every 1 hour) <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Packet Slicing`**: Limits the portion of the packet to be captured, used to save disk space or ensure confidentiality. (Warning: Avoid cutting off header information, checksums may become invalid)(ex. Limit each packet to 4500 bytes, this will allow to capture whole beacon frames, but cut large data frames payload that is non critical for analysis) <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Capture Buffer`**: The amount of memory allocated to hold packets (ex. Buffer Size = 10mb) <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Capture Filter`**: Used to define which packets the sniffer should capture. By setting capture filters, you can limit the captured traffic to only the frames of interest, reducing the amount of data collected and focusing on relevant information. This is not recomended because sometimes you may lose some information. <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Dwell Time Capturing`**: The dwell time is the amount of time a wireless network adapter will stay on a specific RF channel before moving the next channel that the device is capable of or is set to scan within the software. A shorter dwell time will capture less information on a specific channel but will allow the device to scan all channels at a quicker rate. <br> <br>
- 🎛️ **`Event Trigger Capturing`**: Event triggers can be set to start and end packet captures based on a specific event. This will allow a protocol analyzer to capture frames that may be helpful in troubleshooting intermittent problems when a specific event happens. Event triggers can be very granular to allow for complex captures to be used with troubleshooting WLAN problems.

## 📻⚙️ Frame Capture: `Channel Capture & Configuration`
_When capturing network traffic, proper channel capture and configuration are essential to collect the relevant data. Capturing on the wrong channel means missing the traffic you need to analyze. Since there are many channels, it's crucial to know which specific channel or channels to target for your troubleshooting needs._

- 📻 **`Fixed Channel`**: Capture in one single channel :: For troubleshooting a particular device that is using a particular channel. Some adapters can be configured even with channel bandwith, primary or secondary channel, etc. (ex. capturing only channel 11 of 2.4 GHz because AP and STA are using that channel) <br> <br>
- 📻 **`Channel Scan`**: Capture the whole picture of the BSA channels and bands :: Select every single channel to do a channel hopping method, some adapters can go from 2.4 GHz to 5 GHz hopping. The tradeoff of this capture technique is that you will miss what is happening in others channels while you are hopping from one channel to another. <br> <br>
- 📻 **`Channel Aggregation (Multiple adapters + Multiple fixed channels)`**: If you have more than 1 adapter you can capture on different channels at same time and you won't miss anything. (ex. with 3 adapters you can capture channel 1, 6 & 11 of 2.4 GHz at same time)

## 🤳🏾🪤📡 802.11 Frame Capture: `Location for Capture`
_In 802.11 Frames Capture is very important the physical location of the adapter that will capture 802.11 Frames depending on what are we tring to capture, it's important to remember that we are capturing on wireless medium (RF flying through the air)_

- 🪤 **`Near the AP`**: Capture that AP sees :: This location is ideal for capturing all the traffic within the Basic Service Area (BSA) and the communications between the Access Point (AP) and its connected clients. It helps in analyzing the overall network performance and the interaction between the AP and multiple clients. Generally, to troubleshoot a channel-wide problem, you will start with a capture near the AP. <br> <br>
- 🪤 **`Near the Client`**: Capture that Client sees :: This setup is useful for diagnosing issues specific to a particular client. By capturing frames from the client's perspective, you can identify problems related to that client’s connection, such as connectivity issues, interference, or performance bottlenecks. <br> <br>
- 🪤 **`In the middle of Client & AP`**: For getting the whole picture of whats happening inside the BSA :: Capture a comprehensive view of the communication. Positioning the adapter between the client and the AP provides a balanced perspective of the entire interaction. This location allows for capturing both the client and AP transmissions, offering a full picture of the communication flow within the BSA.

## 📡🪤🖧 802.11 Frame Catpure: `802.3 Wired Ethernet` + `802.11 Wireless Wi-Fi` at same time
_Capturing and troubleshooting both wired (802.3 Ethernet) and wireless (802.11 Wi-Fi) traffic simultaneously is sometimes necessary. This dual approach provides a complete view of network interactions, especially for complex troubleshooting scenarios._

- 🖧📡 **`EAP over LAN exchanges & RADIUS`**: Simultaneous capture of Wi-Fi and Ethernet is crucial for analyzing authentication exchanges. By capturing both the wireless and wired sides of the network, you can ensure that authentication processes, such as those using EAP and RADIUS, are functioning correctly and efficiently. <br> <br>
- 🖧📡 **`DHCP exchanges`**: Capturing DHCP traffic on both Wi-Fi and Ethernet helps in diagnosing issues related to IP address assignment. It ensures that DHCP requests and responses are correctly handled across both mediums, providing a comprehensive view of the DHCP process. <br> <br>
- 🖧📡 **`QoS`**: Analyzing QoS tags and markings across the entire network, including both wireless and wired segments, is essential for applications like VoIP. This ensures that QoS configurations are consistent throughout the network, maintaining optimal performance and prioritization of critical traffic. It's important when troubleshooting QoS in wireless networks be sure that the QoS is working correctly in wired medium and the whole Distribution System. <br> <br>
- 🖧📡 **`VLAN Tagging`**: Capturing VLAN tags on both Wi-Fi and Ethernet is necessary for verifying correct VLAN VS SSIDs configurations. This helps in ensuring that VLANs are properly propagated and handled across the entire network, facilitating accurate traffic segregation and management. For example when you configure a VLAN for specific SSID. 

## 📦👀📄 Frame Analysis: `Packet Views`
_Understanding network traffic through packet views is crucial for effective analysis. Here are the key packet views used in protocol analyzers._

### 📄👀 General Views:

- Packet List View: This is the main view of a protocol analyzer and shows the columns/list of all the packets captured. (ex. Wireshark has this in the top of a default configuration.) <br> <br>
- Packet Decode View: Very important view in protocol analyzers for packet analysis. It shows a "human read" format organized from lower layers to upper layers bits/bytes information in a "directory style". This contains all the packet information, elements, payloads, radiotap header, PPI, flags, fields names & values (ex. control field), etc. (ex .Wireshark has this in the bottom left of a default configuration.) <br> <br> 
- HEX / Binary / ASCII encoding views: This is the HEX or binary version of the decode view. It shows a "machine read" format of the packet. Wireshark has this in the bottom right of a default configuration.  <br> <br>
- Wireless Views: This is only available in Wireless packet analysis tools and make easier to see information about channel utilization, retries, authenticatins, top channels, top APs, top STAs, etc. 

### 🔎👀 Display, Filter & Profiles Views:

- Display Filter: Used to refine the view of captured data in the Protocol Analyzer. They help isolate specific packets within a capture file based on various criteria, making it easier to focus on the relevant traffic during analysis. This is more recommended than using a capture filter, because you can capture all the data without losing data and then isolate only the packets you want to see. <br> <br>
- Color Filter: highlight specific types of packets in the Wireshark interface. By applying color filters, you can quickly identify different kinds of traffic, making it easier to spot patterns and anomalies during analysis. <br> <br>
- Custom Colors: Custom colors allow you to set specific colors for different types of packets. This customization enhances visual analysis and helps in quickly distinguishing between various traffic types. <br> <br>
- Custom Columns: Enable you to add specific fields to the packet list pane. This feature allows you to display the most relevant information directly in the main view, making it easier to analyze the captured data. <br> <br>
- Custom Profiles: Let you save different configurations of Wireshark settings, including filters, color schemes, and columns. This is useful for switching between different analysis setups quickly and efficiently. For example, you can use a profile to troubleshoot DHCP in ethernet captures and other profile to troubleshooit association in 802.11 Wi-Fi. 

### 📊👀 Advanced Features & Graphic Views:

- 📊 Statistics & Graphics: Some Protocol Analyzers provides various statistical tools and graphical representations to summarize and visualize the captured data. These tools can help identify trends, anomalies, and potential issues in the network traffic. For example, in 802.11 Wi-Fi you can analyze the airtime utilization filter and identify high utilization over the time, the top talking APs, the top talking STAs, etc. <br> <br>
- 📊 Expert Analysis: The automatic detection of network events, errors, and problems by an analyzer. For example: Heuristic-based expert analysis looks for patterns in the traffic flow and compares them to a set of rules configured by default in the analysis software (in wireshark you can see sometimes a colored indicator with "expert" quote, showing some relevant information). <br> <br>
- 📊 Endpoints / Protocol List: This window shows statistics about the endpoints captured. For each supported protocol, a tab is shown in this window. Each tab label shows the number of endpoints captured (e.g., the tab label “Ethernet · 4” tells you that four ethernet endpoints have been captured). If no endpoints of a specific protocol were captured, the tab label will be greyed out (although the related page can still be selected). <br> <br>
- 📊 Node Lists / Conversations: The conversations window is similar to the endpoint Window. Along with addresses, packet counters, and byte counters the conversation window adds four columns: the start time of the conversation (“Rel Start”) or (“Abs Start”), the duration of the conversation in seconds, and the average bits (not bytes) per second in each direction. A timeline graph is also drawn across the “Rel Start” / “Abs Start” and “Duration” columns. <br> <br>
- 📊 Peer Map: A peer map is used to show frame exchanges between stations (STA’s) that are communicating within a WLAN BSS. This can be a valuable visual representation that may be very useful in troubleshooting WLAN problems.

## 📦⏳🎣 Frame Analysis: `Time Metric Columns`
_Various time metric columns provide insights into different aspects of packet timing._

- ⏳ **`Absolute time`** / **`Arrival Time`**: Display the time the packet was captured based on the system clock in the computer, this is the actual capture date and time based on the time zone of the capture device, this means, the time when the packet was captured, provides the real-world time of packet capture for example date and hour. This metric is useful for correlating captured data with real-world events and time-based troubleshooting. <br> <br>
- ⏳ **`Delta time`**: This is the elapsed time from the previous packet to the current packet, this means, measures the time elapsed between successive packets. This metric helps in understanding the time intervals between packet transmissions, which can be useful for performance analysis. <br> <br>
- ⏳ **`Relative time`**: This is the time from the first packet in a capture file, but it can be also similar to the Seconds Since Beginning of Capture option. Cumulative time from a selected packet to another selected packet, it can be used to identify how long it takes for a frame exchange to occur. Some protocol analyzer software programs make this a very simple task. This information is valuable in determining problems such as latency or contention with specific frame exchanges. (ex. in a 4-way-handshake you can select the first frame, and then look how many time does the 4th frame took)

## Frame Analysis: `Name Resolution`
_Name resolution tries to convert some of the numerical address values into a human readable format. There are different possible ways to do these conversions, depending on the resolution to be done: calling system/network services (like the gethostname() function) and/or resolving from specific configuration files. Name resolution can be achieved in different ways:_ <br> <br>

- Passive Discovery: Automatically add names found in captured packets
- Active Resolution: Query names via DNS or WINS
- Manually add: Added manual bu the user (ex. take one specific MAC Address and call it "John_PC")
- Import List: Import from a .txt or .csv file

## Frame Analysis: `Decrypting Frames`
_Tools like Wireshark can decrypt WEP and WPA/WPA2/WPA3 in pre-shared (or personal) mode. WPA/WPA2 enterprise mode decryption works also since Wireshark 2.0, with some limitations. You can add decryption keys using Wireshark's 802.11 preferences or by using the wireless toolbar. Up to 64 keys are supported. **IMPORTANT NOTE: WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3 must have captured 4-way-handshake for decryption**_

## Wireshark DHCP Filters

- `bootp`: In Wireshark, to filter and view only DHCP traffic, you would use the filter bootp. This filter captures both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 traffic because DHCP messages are transported using BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol) in IPv4 networks, and Wireshark uses bootp as the filter for this traffic.







































# 📡📻📊 Spectrum Analysis
_Sometimes there's something in the enviorment that is not 802.11 MAC Layer signal, and there's no way to capture this kind of interference with a protocol analyzer or Wi-Fi analyzer. Spectrum Analyzers are tools that help to find something based on the existance of RF Energy. This tools have different features and capabilities to help to find RF signatures, The RF signature can be consider as a fingerprint of a electromagnetic radiation signal._

## `Oscilloscope - Time Domain` VS `Spectrum Analyzer - Frequency Domain`
_Spectrum analyzers are **frequency domain tools** used to measure amplitude in a finite frequency space. Wireless Engineers use spectrum analyzers to locate sources of interference that may have a negative impact on the 802.11 network as well as other protocols that operate in the same frequency, 2.4 or 5GHz._

Difference between a spectrum analyzer and an oscilloscope:

- Oscilloscope: Used to measure the timing information around a signal. 
- Spectrum Analyzer: is used to measure frequency information on a signal

Difference between Time Domain & Frequency Domain

- `Time Domain`: Seen by a Osciloscope :: The RF in a time domain is where you can see the sine waves (or any other form) being generated.
- `Frequency Domain`: Seen by a Spectrum Analyzer :: Is like see the wave "coming at us". This means, signal strenghts on a frequency, and this is achieved using the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)

## Spectrum Analyzer: `Types`

Spectrum Analyzers can be classified in 3 basic categories in reference to their architecture: 

- Real-time Spectrum Analyzers (RSA or RSTA):
- Swept Spectrum Analyzers (SA):
- Vector Signal Analyzers (VSA):

## 📈 Spectrum Views
_It is very important to understand what information can be understood from the different views_

- RF signal can represent in either time domain or frequency domain.
- Once you do Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) for a time domain signal you can get the Frequency domain signal.
- In RF, mostly Frequency Domain representation is more useful.

Here are some different views available in a spectrum analyzer:

---

### 📈📏 Spectrum Views: `Real time FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)`

❗ Frequency represent in horizontal axis and the energy in **`dBm defined`** in vertical axis

- This view is considered a **Real-time Spectrum Analyzer (RSA).**
- The key words of FFT are **`real-time`**; **the information shown is live.**. That's why the FFT graphics are common named as **Real Time FFT**. <br><br>
- FFT is an algorithm that samples a signal over a period of time or space divides it into its frequency components. This means, the FFT decomposes a signal into its component frequencies and their amplitudes. <br><br>
- The spectrum analyzer captures the RF energy within the time domain and converts the information to the frequency domain using the FFT process which is then viewable without gaps. <br><br>
- FFT can be explained as: "Measurments of points in the time of the spectrum". Each "point" es marked at the midde of each "FFT bin"

Concepts used in FFT:

- **`FFT Bin`**:  <br><br>
    - The resolution bandwidth (RBW) is dictated by the size of the FFT Bin
    - Folowwing statistics are gathered for each bin: Average Power, Max Power, Duty Cicle  <br><br>
- **`Sampling Rate`**: <br><br>
    - How often the spectrum analyzer takes measurments  <br><br>
- **`Dwell time`**: <br><br>
    - The amount of time spent measuring each sample    

---

### 📈💯 Spectrum Views: `Duty Cycle` / `Channel Utilization`

❗ Show the **`percent (%)`** of channel utilization

- In this veiw you can see whether a device is constantly using a frequency (100% duty cycle on a particular channel mean it is not usable & caused by sort of jammers)
- Displays a measurement of the amount of time a received signal amplitude is above the noise floor or another arbitrary threshold
- Although the term duty cycle can be subjective based on the context in which it is used within WLAN technology, it is commonly identifies the percentage of time an RF signal is above a specific threshold. A high duty cycle such as 95-100% can indicate a problem such as an RF jammer or other devise that is causing high utilization of the RF channel.
- Channel utilization shows the percentage of time that the frequency is in use over a period of time. The software in use determines the threshold, some may use the noise floor where others may use a higher value.
- For example, Aruba documentation states “The spectrum analysis feature considers a frequency bin to be utilized if the detected power in that bin is at least 20 dB higher than the nominal noise floor on that channel.” This is a general measure of how busy the network is.
- Channel utilization measures both Wi-Fi and non-Wi-Fi devices.
- Duty cycle percentage is used to identify the amount of time a single device is active. Ekahau shows utilization percentages per channel in real time. Spectrum XT shows “Duty Cycle” percentage but doesn’t reference any single device (this is channel utilization labeled as duty cycle.)

---

### 📈⏳ Spectrum Views: `Swept Spectrogram` & `Waterfall View`

❗ In this view vertical axis shows the **`historical data (similar to a waterfall rectangle from Up-to-Down)`**

- This view is considered a **Swept Spectrum Analyzer (SA).**
- This is the **same information as the real-time FFT** but often in a different view and tracked over a longer period.
- These views can often be configured within software to specify the length of time.
- The **Waterfall View** is the information from the **swept spectrogram** showing: time, frequency, and power but viewed vertically.

---

### 📈🌈 Spectrum Views: `Power Spectral Density` / `Density View`

❗ Horizontal axis represent frequency & vertical axis represent energy in dBm with **`brightness of color`** being determined by how many times that specific bit of information has been captured.

- **Power Spectral Density** can be also referred to as **spectrum density**
- Useful for find repetition of **data points** over time to help locate the interferer.
- The density view in a spectrum analyzer will show the data points that a specific frequency is hit within a channel or band. Choosing a color scheme will help to show these events. This can be used to help identify an RF transmitter and interferer.
- It shows where detected RF energy variations are stronger and where variations are weaker.
- This is the primary view in Ekahau; you can add the real-time FFT average or max sweep to show overtop of the density view as well.
- Spectrum density views use colors to indicate the channel utilization. (eg. Ekahau uses green to represent low utilization and red/black to show high/very high utilization.)

---

### 📈🛜 Spectrum Views: WLAN Integration

❗ Spectrum Analysis + Information of WLANs similar to a **`Wi-Fi analyzer tool (SSIDs name, RSSI, etc)`**

- When spectrum analyzer has WiFi integration capability, it can combined those views. WiFi NIC can scan other channels & report that information to give a overall view on a particular band.
- Spectrum analyzers show layer one information. It is frequently useful to view information from layer 2 within the same views. WLAN integration with spectrum analysis software enables this feature. The images below show the SSIDs and number of APs in Spectrum XT. We can also see detailed information in Ekahau about the APs, the SSIDs they broadcast, along with operating and capability information.


## SNR and Noise Floor

The amount of background energy, Wi-Fi and non, is the noise floor. It is always important to know the amount of noise in an area because wireless networks are designed around devices and applications. For example, Voice-grade wireless expects a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 25dB. To calculate the SNR of a signal, we take the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and noise floor value (-92dBm in the example below). The difference between these two values is the SNR. Each device has a unique receive sensitivity and will perceive the RSSI and noise floor differently than others. This results in newer devices, with higher receive sensitivity, being able to demodulate the same data rates at greater distances than older devices. Know that a large percentage of noise comes from access points and client devices. To fully understand what the noise floor is in a given area, you should survey or perform spectrum analysis during a time of normal usage.

- [Wifi Surveyor](https://rfexplorer.com/wifisurveyor/)

### Access Point Based
_Centralized infrastructure allows for coordinated RBW adjustments across multiple access points (APs). This can ensure that spectrum analysis is performed optimally across the network, minimizing interference and maximizing signal clarity. In contrast, laptop-based analyzers may not have this coordinated control and optimization capability._

## Spectrum Analysis Views / Displays



## Spectrum Analysis Displays:

- Real-time FFT: Phase Domain - Frequency represent in horizontal axis and the energy in dBm defined in vertical axis
- FFT Duty Cycle - This view displays the percentage of time the ambient RF signal is higher than the noise floor or other predefined signal threshold. In this veiw you can see whether a device is constantly using a frequency (100% duty cycle on a particular channel mean it is not usable & caused by sort of jammers)
- Spectrogram Graph (Waterfall plot) - This use the same data from Real Time FFT, but with the addition of time dimension. In this view vertical axis shows the historical data. In this case energy in dB values represent in colors (Blue to RED to represent weaker to stronger energy).
- Spectrum Density - Horizontal axis represent frequency & vertical axis represent energy in dBm with brightness of color being determined by how many times that specific bit of information has been captured.
- WiFi integration - When spectrum analyzer has WiFi integration capability, it can combined those views. WiFi NIC can scan other channels & report that information to give a overall view on a particular band.



### Spectrum Analysis: `Duty Cicle`
_Spectrum analyzer displays a measurement of the amount of time a received signal amplitude is above the noise floor or another arbitrary threshold. Although the term duty cycle can be subjective based on the context in which it is used within WLAN technology, it is commonly identifies the percentage of time an RF signal is above a specific threshold. A high duty cycle such as 95-100% can indicate a problem such as an RF jammer or other devise that is causing high utilization of the RF channel._

## ℹ️🏎️📏 iPerf3
_iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6). For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters. This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original iPerf and also is not backwards compatible._

## 🔭🔍🛜 WLAN Scan & BSS Discovery
_A Wi-Fi analyzer tool helps you track and analyze your wireless network's performance with ease. With WiFi Analyzer's network admins can collect information from different wireless components such as WLCs and access points to determine the availability and performance of your wireless network._

- [NetSpot]()

## 🔭🕵️‍♂️🛜 WLAN Scan & Monitoring: airmon-ng
_airmon-ng script can be used to enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces. It may also be used to kill network managers, or go back from monitor mode to managed mode. Entering the airmon-ng command without parameters will show the interfaces status._

## 📣💊🧮 Beacon/SSID Overhead Calculation
_One of the most commonly cited best practices among Wi-Fi professionals is to the limit the number of SSIDs you have configured on your WLAN in order to reduce the amount of overhead on the network and to maintain high performance. **CWNP Standard = no more than 5 SSIDs, for best results maximum 3 SSIDs**_
- [**`SSID Overhead Calculator`**](https://revolutionwifi.blogspot.com/p/ssid-overhead-calculator.html)

## 🛜🖩🧮 MCS Index Table
_The MCS table evaluates the quality of the RF environment- the RF media that devices are working in, which is reflected in every single transmission || Every transmitter device, whether it be an AP or a client, will make an internal decision of which MCS it is going to use || MCS summarizes and categorizes Wi-Fi parameters such as modulation, coding scheme, guard interval, and channel width. || The modulation and coding used, in relation to the channel bandwidth and number of spatial streams, are key determiners in the final data rate of the link. Given that a better signal quality is required for more complex modulation methods, devices fall back to less complex modulation methods as the signal quality degrades. The result is a lowering of the data rate. This process is called Dynamic Rate Switching (DRS). The 802.11 standard does not define the DRS algorithm from the perspective of signal quality, this definition is the responsibility of the chipset manufacturers. The 802.11 standard defines only that the STA must use a permitted data rate for transmission and this permitted list is found in Beacon frames and Probe Response frames from the associated AP._

## True Wi-Fi Performance
_Even if you getting for example 360mbps of Data Rate, it will noever be the actual Throughput at the end. ||_
**Actual/Real Throughput =** <br>
`Data Rate` :: Obtained by MCS Index Table || Actual Data Rate Available per STA (Varies by Signal Quality) then: <br>
`Management Overhead` :: Airtime Consumed by BSS Operations & CCI (Co-Channel Interference) <br>
`Interference` :: Non Wi-Fi interference casuing retries <br>
`Other STAs` :: Per STA Throughput
