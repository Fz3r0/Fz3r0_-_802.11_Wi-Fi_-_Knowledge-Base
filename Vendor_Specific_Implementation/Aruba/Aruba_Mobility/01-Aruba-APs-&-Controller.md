# üèùÔ∏èüì° Aruba Mobility :: `Access Points (APs) and Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC)`

Aruba offers a wide portfolio of Access Points designed for **different environments and use cases**. Broadly, APs are categorized as **indoor** or **outdoor** models. While their Wi-Fi capabilities are often similar (support for 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax, multiple radios, MIMO chains), their **physical design, durability, uplink options, and cost** vary significantly depending on the deployment scenario.

## üè† Indoor APs

- **Purpose:** Designed for climate-controlled environments like offices, hospitals, schools, and retail spaces.  
- **Enclosure:** Lightweight plastic housing, aesthetic design, and ceiling/wall mounting.  
- **Antennas:** Can be **integrated** or **external** depending on the model (e.g., AP-325 internal vs AP-324 external).  
- **Power & Ports:** Usually dual copper Ethernet ports (1G or 2.5G), with **PoE-in** and sometimes **LACP**. Optional DC input.  
- **Cost:** Cheaper than outdoor APs because they don‚Äôt require ruggedization.  
- **Use Cases:** High-density office floors, classrooms, auditoriums, healthcare, or warehouses.

## üå¶Ô∏è Outdoor APs

- **Purpose:** Ruggedized for harsh environments: stadiums, ports, parking lots, outdoor campuses, industrial yards.  
- **Enclosure:** Weather-sealed **IP-rated chassis** with surge protection, UV resistance, and extended temperature range (**‚Äì40 ¬∞C to +65 ¬∞C**).  
- **Antennas:** Typically external or integrated into directional/omni outdoor housings.  
- **Power & Ports:** At least one copper **PoE-in** port, often complemented by an **SFP slot (1G fiber)** for longer uplinks.  
- **Cost:** Higher due to environmental certification, rugged chassis, and mounting hardware.  
- **Use Cases:** Long-distance mesh links, outdoor Wi-Fi coverage, stadium/arena density, mining/industrial connectivity.

## üí° Aruba APs Design Notes

- **Regulatory Domains:** Aruba APs ship with domain codes (e.g., `-US` for United States, `-RW` for Rest of World, `-IL` for Israel, `-JP` for Japan). The domain defines allowed channels and Tx power.  
- **SSIDs:** Up to **16 per radio**, but best practice is ‚â§4 to minimize beacon overhead.  
- **Power Considerations:** With **802.3bt (PoE++)**, all features are enabled. With **802.3af (basic PoE)**, the AP may disable features like USB or a radio, managed by **IPM (Intelligent Power Monitoring)**.  
- **USB Port:** Typically USB 2.0; rarely used in enterprises except for 4G/LTE modems.  

### üåç Regulatory/Ordering Regions

Common suffixes on SKUs: **-US** (United States/FCC), **-RW** (Rest of World), **-JP** (Japan), **-IL** (Israel).  
> Region is enforced in hardware; **-RW cannot be used in the US**.

## üì¶ Example Indoor Model ‚Äî Aruba **AP-515** (510 Series)

**Platform:** Dual-radio Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax); backward compatible with a/b/g/n/ac.  
**Radios/MIMO:** 2.4 GHz **2√ó2:2**, 5 GHz **4√ó4:4**.  
**Antenna Options:**  
- AP-514 ‚Üí external antennas.  
- AP-515 ‚Üí integrated antennas.  
**SSIDs:** Up to **16 per radio**.  
**IoT:** BLE + Zigbee built-in.  
**Ports:**  
- **E0:** 2.5G PoE-in (802.3af/at/bt).  
- **E1:** 1G, no PoE.  
- LACP supported on E0+E1.  
**Other:** DC input (priority over PoE), USB-A 2.0 (~5W), micro-USB console.  
**Power/IPM:**  
- With 802.3bt/at/DC ‚Üí no restrictions.  
- With 802.3af ‚Üí works with reduced features under IPM.

## üõ†Ô∏è Controllers ‚Äî MM & MC (Virtual vs Hardware Controllers)

Aruba offers both **virtual** and **hardware** appliances for its controller architecture. The choice depends on **scale, resiliency, and deployment model**. Both support the same ArubaOS 8.x features (MM hierarchy, licensing, configuration model), but they differ in **performance, form factor, and scaling capacity**.

- **Mobility Master (MM):** Top of the **hierarchical configuration model**; centralizes **configuration**, **licensing**, **image upgrades**, and **visibility/monitoring**. Supports **multi-version** domains. **APs do not join the MM**.  
- **Mobility Controller (MC):** Terminates AP tunnels and handles **client control/data plane** (roles/ACL/AAA, VLANs, DHCP relay, etc.). _(Also known as Managed Node/Device (MN/MD))_

## üìÇ Mobility Master (MM)

The **Mobility Master** is always at the top of the hierarchy. It centralizes **configuration, licensing, and monitoring**, and manages one or more **Mobility Controllers (MCs)** (which become Managed Nodes under MM).

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Virtual MM (MM-VA)

- Deployed on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or KVM.
- Scales based on SKU: `MM-VA-50 / 500 / 1K / 5K / 10K`.
- Licensing defines capacity in **number of devices (MCs)** and **clients**.

Example:  

- `MM-VA-50`: supports 50 devices, ~500 clients, 5 controllers.  
- `MM-VA-1K`: supports 1,000 devices, ~10,000 clients, 100 controllers.  
- `MM-VA-10K`: supports 10,000 devices, ~100,000 clients, 1,000 controllers.

### ü™® Hardware MM (MM-HW)

- Purpose-built appliance with console, management, and **10G SFP+ ports**.
- Models: `MM-HW-1K / 5K / 10K`.

Example:  

- `MM-HW-1K`: 1,000 devices, 10,000 clients, ~100 controllers.  
- `MM-HW-10K`: 10,000 devices, 100,000 clients, ~1,000 controllers.
- Offers **dedicated compute power** and avoids shared virtualization overhead.

## üì¶ Mobility Controller (MC)

The **Mobility Controller** terminates AP tunnels, authenticates clients, and enforces policies. When connected to an MM, it is called a **Managed Node (MN)**. MCs can be either **virtual** or **hardware appliances**.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Virtual MC (MC-VA)

- Deployed on the same hypervisors as MM-VA (ESXi, Hyper-V, KVM).
- SKU depends on license and compute resources.
- Ideal for **lab environments**, **small branches**, or **cloud-first strategies**.

### ü™® Hardware MC

- **7000 Series:** Compact branch/SMB controllers.  
  - Examples: 7005, 7008, 7010, 7024, 7030.  
  - Scale: up to ~4,096 users, with PoE ports for small sites.

- **7200 Series:** High-performance enterprise controllers.  
  - Examples: 7205, 7210, 7220, 7240XM, 7280.  
  - Scale: up to ~32,768 concurrent users.  
  - Multiple 10G SFP+ uplinks, larger session handling, high-density support.

## üìä Virtual vs Hardware ‚Äî Quick Comparison

| Feature | **Virtual MM/MC** | **Hardware MM/MC** |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Deployment** | Runs on hypervisors (ESXi, KVM, Hyper-V). | Dedicated appliance with ArubaOS preloaded. |
| **Performance** | Scales with compute (CPU/RAM); overhead of virtualization. | Predictable throughput with optimized hardware. |
| **Networking** | Uses VM NICs (limited by host capabilities). | 1G/10G/40G ports, hardware acceleration. |
| **Scale** | MM-VA up to 10k devices / 100k clients. | MM-HW up to 10k devices / 100k clients. |
| **Use Case** | Labs, small/medium enterprises, cloud-centric. | Large campuses, DC hubs, high-density enterprise. |
| **Cost** | Lower upfront (reuse existing virtualization). | Higher upfront, but dedicated and robust. |

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Hierarchies

- **Single MM + multiple MCs** ‚Üí centralized config/licensing with scalability.  
- **Dual (redundant) MMs + multiple MCs** ‚Üí high availability, config/state sync.  
- **Standalone MCs** (no MM) ‚Üí simpler, but lose centralized licensing and hierarchy.

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Same ArubaOS**: Both virtual and hardware platforms run the same ArubaOS 8.x features.  
- **MM = brains** (hierarchy, licensing, visibility); **MC = muscle** (tunnel termination, client handling).  
- **Virtual = flexibility & cost efficiency**, **Hardware = predictable performance & scale**.
