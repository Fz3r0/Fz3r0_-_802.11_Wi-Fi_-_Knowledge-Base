# üèùÔ∏èüì° Aruba Mobility :: `AOS 8x Architecture`

Aruba 8.x Architecture introduces a centralized and scalable design where the **Mobility Master (MM)** acts as the central brain for configuration, licensing, monitoring, and upgrades, while the **Mobility Controllers (MC)**, also known as **Managed Nodes (MN)** when under an MM, handle APs and client traffic. Using a **hierarchical configuration model**, all policies flow top-down from the MM, enabling flexibility across global, regional, and site levels, with deployment options ranging from a single MM with multiple MCs to redundant MMs for high availability.

## üß† Mobility Master (MM)

**Definition:** The central brain of the Aruba 8.x architecture. It does not handle client traffic but manages the configuration, licenses, monitoring, and upgrades of all Mobility Controllers (MC).  

**Functions:**  

- **Hierarchical Configuration Model:** Configuration flows top-down, from the MM to the MCs (Managed Nodes).  
- **Centralized Licensing:** The MM acts as a license server and distributes licenses to all MCs.  
- **Centralized Image Upgrades:** Software images are uploaded once to the MM and distributed to all MCs.  
- **Centralized Visibility & Monitoring:** A single dashboard for APs, clients, and network policies.  
- **Multi-Version Support:** An MM can manage MCs running different, but compatible, versions of ArubaOS.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** APs never connect directly to an MM. Only MCs terminate AP tunnels and handle client data (in case the AP is tunneled).

## üì¶ Mobility Controller (MC) / Managed Node (MN)

**Definition:** The device that terminates AP tunnels, authenticates clients, and handles client traffic (if tunneled).  

- When standalone, it is simply called an **MC**.  
- When connected under an MM, it becomes a **Managed Node (MN)**.  
- In some Aruba documentation, you will also see the term **Managed Device (MD)**, which is used interchangeably with **Managed Node (MN)**.

**Role in the hierarchy:**  

- Inherits configuration from the MM.  
- Receives licenses from the MM.  
- Runs the control plane + data plane for APs and clients.

‚úÖ **Key Point:** Every MN is an MC, but not every MC is an MN **(only when managed by an MM)**.  

## üóÇÔ∏è Hierarchical Configuration Model

**Concept:** Configuration is structured and flows from the top down.  

1. **Global (root at MM):** Policies and parameters applied to all nodes.  
2. **Folders (e.g., geo-loc1, geo-loc2):** Logical separation by region or function.  
3. **Groups (e.g., site1, site2):** Site-specific configuration.  
4. **MC/MN:** The final node that enforces configuration and serves APs and clients.  

**Advantages:**  

- Centralized and scalable management.  
- Flexibility to apply global, regional, or site-specific settings.  
- Reduces misconfiguration and improves consistency.

## üèõÔ∏è Deployment Designs

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ One MM with Multiple MCs

- The most common enterprise design.  
- One MM at HQ, managing several MCs deployed at different data centers or branches.  
- All licenses, policies, and upgrades flow from the MM.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Redundant MMs with Multiple MCs

- Recommended for high availability.  
- Two MMs in a cluster (Primary/Backup).  
- If one MM fails, the other continues managing licensing, configuration, and monitoring.  
- MCs remain operational, connected to APs and clients without disruption.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Standalone MC

- A single MC without an MM.  
- Manages APs and clients directly.  
- Simpler, but lacks hierarchical configuration, centralized licensing, and unified upgrades.

## ü§î What happens if you configure directly on the MC insteaf of MM?

In ArubaOS 8.x, when using a **Mobility Master (MM)** with multiple **Mobility Controllers (MCs)**, the **hierarchical configuration model** applies.  

- This means the **MM is always the single source of truth** for configuration.

How to configure?

- ‚úÖ Local commands for **troubleshooting** (show, debug, packet capture) ‚Üí **OK**.  
- ‚ùå **Persistent configuration** (VLANs, SSIDs, roles, AAA, policies) ‚Üí **Not valid**; it may appear to work but will be **overwritten** at the next sync from the MM.  

For example, in a deployment with **1√ó MM + 2√ó MCs (or more)**, all real configuration must be done at the **MM level**. The MCs only inherit and enforce, they do not keep their own permanent config.

### ‚úÖ Configuration Best Practice

- **ALWAYS** configure at the **MM**!!!

Configuring directly on the MC is **not a best practice** because it does not survive synchronization and can create inconsistencies.

Any config made directly on the MC (when it is managed by an MM) will eventually be **overwritten** the next time the MM pushes its configuration down. This is by design, since the MM controls policies, VLANs, SSIDs, roles, and firewall rules for the entire managed network.

There are some exceptions:  

- Disaster Recovery: A bad configuration was pushed from MM and now MC is unaccesible. 
- Local operational commands (debug, show, packet captures) can still be executed directly on the MC.  
- Temporary changes may work for a short time but will not persist after a config sync.  

### üö® Disaster Recovery Mode

In case of an issue for example if a **bad configuration is pushed from the MM** and the MD becomes unreachable there is a special **Disaster Recovery Mode**.

- Allows the administrator to access and configure the MD **locally**, bypassing the MM.  
- While in this mode, the MD blocks any further config sync from the MM.  
- The admin now has **full control** of the MD and can apply emergency fixes.  
- Once changes are complete, Disaster Recovery Mode must be disabled so the MD can sync back to the MM.

## üóÇÔ∏è Aruba Configuration Hierarchy

ArubaOS 8.x introduces a **hierarchical configuration model** that follows a strict **top-to-bottom inheritance**.  
Any configuration applied at a higher level in the hierarchy is automatically **pushed down** to all lower levels, unless overridden at a more specific node.

### üå≥ Structure Overview

The hierarchy is built like a **tree**, with `/root` at the top. Each level refines configuration scope:

<img width="1011" height="578" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7bf82a3-9a55-4403-b85b-3c798f730d71" />

1. **/root**  
   - Absolute top of the tree.  
   - A logical node; **no configuration can be applied here**.  
   - It has two ‚Äúbranches‚Äù: one toward the **Mobility Master (MM)** system group, and another toward the **Managed Network**.

2. **System Group**  
   - Example: `Mobility Master`, `Managed Network`.  
   - The **Mobility Master system group** is only a container for the physical or virtual MMs.  
   - The **Managed Network system group** contains all site controllers and sub-hierarchies.

3. **Group**  
   - Example: `Site Controllers`.  
   - Configuration applied here is inherited by all subgroups and devices inside.  
   - **If I configure at "Site Controllers" ‚Üí settings push down to Europe + Asia ‚Üí then to MC1 and MC2**.

4. **Sub Group**  
   - Example: `Europe`, `Asia`.  
   - Narrower scope; config applies only to the devices within.  
   - **If I configure only "Europe" ‚Üí only MC1 inherits**.

5. **Managed Devices (MCs)**  
   - The lowest level.  
   - Here live the **Mobility Controllers (MC1, MC2, MC_US, etc.)**.  
   - They receive inherited configuration unless something is overridden at a higher subgroup.

### üìå Key Points

- **Top-down push:** Changes made at higher levels propagate down automatically.  
- **Granularity:** You can choose to configure broadly (e.g., all controllers in "Site Controllers") or very specifically (e.g., only MC1 in "Europe").  
- **/root limitation:** Even though `/root` is visible, it is a **non-editable node**. Configuration must start below it.  
- **Mobility Master side:**  
  - The `Mobility Master` system group is just a container.  
  - Inside it, you place one or two physical/virtual MM nodes (for redundancy).  
- **Managed Network side:**  
  - Holds the logical organization of controllers, grouped by geography, function, or site.  
  - Example: `Asia` subgroup with MC2, `Europe` subgroup with MC1, `US` subgroup with MC_US.

### üñºÔ∏è Example: Configuration Propagation

- **Config at ‚ÄúSite Controllers‚Äù group**  
  ‚Üí Inherited by **Europe** and **Asia** subgroups ‚Üí then applied to **MC1** and **MC2**.  

- **Config at ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù subgroup**  
  ‚Üí Only inherited by **MC1**, leaving MC2 untouched.  

- **Config directly at MC1**  
  ‚Üí Affects only that single controller.
