# Aruba AirMatch: Advanced Radio Resource Management for WLANs

**Aruba AirMatch** is an intelligent **Radio Resource Management (RRM - 802.11k)** service designed to enhance Wi-Fi network performance through automated bandwidth, channel, and Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) optimization. By continuously monitoring RF conditions across the network, AirMatch enables WLANs to adapt dynamically to environmental changes, ensuring optimal performance in high-density environments, minimizing co-channel interference (CCI), and providing seamless client roaming.

AirMatch is a cornerstone of Aruba‚Äôs advanced WLAN solutions, delivering intelligent resource allocation for modern Wi-Fi deployments.

## **Key Features of Aruba AirMatch**

### 1. **Dynamic RF Resource Management**

AirMatch analyzes real-time and historical RF data to provide dynamic radio resource management. Key functions include:

- **Channel Allocation**: Assigns the best channels to minimize interference and maximize capacity.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Adjusts channel widths dynamically between 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and even 160 MHz (on supported APs).
- **EIRP Management**: Fine-tunes power settings to minimize signal overlap and EIRP swings across neighboring APs.

| **Feature**       | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Channel Allocation | Dynamically selects optimal channels to reduce CCI and maximize coverage.                                         |
| Bandwidth Scaling  | Automatically adjusts channel widths based on device density and network conditions (e.g., 20/40/80/160 MHz).    |
| Power Adjustment   | Ensures smooth transitions between APs by minimizing power discrepancies and avoiding coverage gaps.             |

---

### 2. **Real-Time RF Monitoring and Adaptation**

Aruba AirMatch uses RF data collected across the entire network to:
- React to local RF events (e.g., radar detection or increased noise floor) by immediately adjusting channel settings.
- Periodically update AP configurations to account for changing environmental conditions.

Examples of RF events and AirMatch responses:

- **Increase in Noise Floor**: AirMatch reallocates APs to cleaner channels to maintain performance.
- **Radar Detection**: Automatically moves affected APs to a non-DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) channel.
- **Client Density Changes**: Scales channel bandwidths based on device count and traffic demands.

---

### 3. **Comprehensive Multi-Band Support**

AirMatch provides full-spectrum optimization for Wi-Fi networks, including the latest advancements in Wi-Fi 6E. Key capabilities include:

- **2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Band Optimization**: Standard optimization of legacy and high-performance bands.
- **6 GHz Band Optimization**: AirMatch intelligently calculates channel and EIRP values for Wi-Fi 6E APs, optimizing operation in the newly available 6 GHz spectrum.
- **160 MHz Bandwidth Support**: Enables high-throughput performance on both 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, dynamically adjusting to network density.

#### Wi-Fi 6E AP Deployment Sequence

AirMatch deploys the radios in Wi-Fi 6E APs in the following order:

1. **2.4 GHz**  
2. **5 GHz** (with a 60-second delay before activating the next band)  
3. **6 GHz**  

This sequence ensures seamless network integration and minimizes potential disruptions.

### 4. **Neighboring AP List and Seamless Roaming**

AirMatch provides a neighboring AP list for each access point, enabling:

- Efficient client handoff between APs for a seamless roaming experience.
- Real-time tracking of client mobility to ensure consistent connectivity, even in high-density or dynamic environments.

| **Feature**                | **Description**                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Neighboring AP List         | Tracks neighboring APs for efficient client handoff and coverage optimization.                     |
| Seamless Roaming Support    | Enhances client mobility by dynamically adjusting RF settings to maintain stable connections.       |

## **AirMatch Operation**

### **Periodic Analysis**

Aruba Central periodically evaluates RF data from all deployed APs and generates configuration updates. These updates ensure the network adapts to current RF conditions and maintains peak efficiency.

### **Channel Bandwidth Adjustment**

AirMatch dynamically adjusts channel bandwidths based on device density:

- **High Device Density**: Reduces channel widths to 20 MHz or 40 MHz for better client distribution.
- **Low Device Density**: Expands channel widths to 80 MHz or 160 MHz to maximize throughput.

### **Channel Optimization Logic**

AirMatch prioritizes Primary Service Channels (PSC) for 6 GHz radio optimization but respects user-defined static channel configurations, even if the channel is non-PSC.
