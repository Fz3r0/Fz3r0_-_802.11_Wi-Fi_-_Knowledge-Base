# üèùÔ∏èüì° Aruba AP Discovery & Provisioning towards Mobility Controller (MC) / Mobility Master (MM)

## üì° P Discovery & Provisioning: `CAP` vs `RAP` vs `IAP`

Aruba delivers Access Points (APs) in different operating modes depending on the deployment architecture. For this discussion, we‚Äôll focus on **CAPs/RAPs**, which operate under controller management (MC/MM).

| Type                 | Mode             | Key Characteristics                                                                                                 | Use Case                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **CAP (Campus AP)**  | Controller-based | Boots with ArubaOS-CAP image. Always establishes a tunnel (GRE/IPsec) to MC/MM for management and data forwarding.  | On-premises enterprise deployments (campus networks). |
| **RAP (Remote AP)**  | Controller-based | Similar to CAP, but designed for remote/home users. Establishes secure IPsec tunnel to MC/MM across the internet.   | Remote workforce, branch offices.                     |
| **IAP (Instant AP)** | Controller-less  | Boots with Aruba InstantOS (IAP) image. Functions autonomously or can form a cluster of IAPs. No controller needed. | Small/medium sites without dedicated controllers.     |

üëâ For **controller-based (CAP/RAP)** deployments, the AP cannot operate standalone, **it must discover and register with an MC/MM before becoming operational.**

## 2. First Connection of an AP to the LAN

When a new AP is connected to the LAN for the first time, it requires basic **L3 connectivity** to reach the controller. This can be achieved via:

### **DHCP (Recommended)**

- The AP sends a DHCP Discover.
- Receives an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server from a DHCP Server.
- Optionally, DHCP option 43/60 can provide the MC/MM IP directly.

### **Static IP**

- The AP is manually configured with IP, subnet mask, gateway, and controller address.
- Useful in networks without DHCP or where static addressing is a policy requirement or for testing purposes.

‚úîÔ∏è In both cases, the AP must know how to reach the controller‚Äôs IP address. If using DNS, the AP resolves `aruba-master` to the MC/MM IP.

## Connection Diagram & Discovery Process

The diagram below illustrates a typical **first-boot scenario** for an Aruba AP (CAP):

### Scenario A: `DHCP-based Discovery`

1. AP powers up via PoE or injector ‚ö°.
2. Sends DHCP Discover through the L2 switch.
3. DHCP server provides:

   * IP address & subnet mask
   * Default gateway
   * DNS server
   * Optionally, Controller IP (DHCP option 43/60)
4. AP uses this info to initiate secure communication with the controller.

### Scenario B: `Static IP (No DHCP)`

* Same topology, but DHCP server is not required.
* Admin pre-configures on the AP:

  * Static IP & mask
  * Gateway
  * DNS (optional)
  * Controller IP address

üëâ In both scenarios, once basic IP reachability is established, the AP downloads its image (if mismatch), provisions itself according to the group profile from MM/MC, and transitions to **‚Äúoperational‚Äù** state.
