# Aruba: `Wireless Products & Modes`

Aruba offers a variety of wireless access points and network solutions designed to optimize connectivity in business environments of all sizes. From standalone access points ideal for small and medium-sized businesses to controller-based solutions for larger networks, Aruba provides flexibility, performance, and scalability. 

Below are the key products and modes offered by Aruba, suitable for various applications, from office spaces to demanding outdoor environments.

# Aruba: `Instant Access Points`

Instant APs are standalone devices that don't require a central controller, making them ideal for small to medium-sized businesses. They offer easy setup, management via a cloud platform or a simple web interface, and are limited in scalability (up to 8 APs). They're perfect for environments that need quick deployment and less complex network management.

## **3. Outdoor Access Points**

| **Model**  | **Key Features** | **Number of Devices Supported** | **Real-Life Use Case** |
|------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| **AP27**   | Weatherproof, IP67-rated, ideal for outdoor use. | Up to 75 active devices. | Perfect for patios, poolsides, or outdoor areas like restaurants and retail spaces. |
| **AP17**   | Durable, weather-resistant, ideal for smaller outdoor locations. | Up to 50 active devices. | Ideal for outdoor cafes, car dealership lots, or open-air restaurants. |


# Aruba: `Controller Based Access Points`

Controller-based APs rely on a centralized Mobility Controller or Mobility Master, offering advanced management, scalability (thousands of APs), and high availability. These systems are better suited for large enterprise networks where advanced features, redundancy, and detailed control over network performance are crucial. They're more complex to set up but provide a more robust and scalable solution for high-demand environments.

### `AP Location Types`

- `Indoor`: Access Points designed for indoor environments, optimized for office, residential, or campus use.
- `Outdoor` & `Ruggedized`: Access Points designed for outdoor environments, including ruggedized options for hazardous conditions or extreme weather.
