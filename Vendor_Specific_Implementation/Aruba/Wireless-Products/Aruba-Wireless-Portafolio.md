## Aruba Mobility Controllers

- https://www.arubanetworks.com/products/wireless/gateways-and-controllers/

Aruba Mobility Controllers are the central components in an enterprise wireless network, responsible for managing and optimizing Wi-Fi performance, security, and scalability. These controllers handle tasks such as traffic routing, access point (AP) configuration, and user authentication, ensuring seamless connectivity across all devices. Available in physical, virtual, and centralized management forms, Mobility Controllers provide flexible solutions for networks of all sizes, from small offices to large-scale deployments like universities, airports, and smart cities.

Enterprise-class performance: Aruba 9200 Series Campus Gateways are modern Wi-Fi appliances that scale to support up to 2,048 APs and 32K devices. Delivers 24x7 reliability, live upgrades, and always-on connectivity. Zero touch provisioning reduces the need for on-site IT support. Meet Aruba‚Äôs next-generation gateway Engineered for mission-critical environments, the Aruba 9200 Series delivers high performance, seamless roaming, consistent policy enforcement, and always-on connectivity ‚Äì even during upgrades.
