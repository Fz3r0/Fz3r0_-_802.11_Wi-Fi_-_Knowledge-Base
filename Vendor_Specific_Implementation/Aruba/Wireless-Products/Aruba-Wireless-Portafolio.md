## Aruba Mobility Controllers

Aruba Mobility Controllers are the central components in an enterprise wireless network, responsible for managing and optimizing Wi-Fi performance, security, and scalability. These controllers handle tasks such as traffic routing, access point (AP) configuration, and user authentication, ensuring seamless connectivity across all devices. Available in physical, virtual, and centralized management forms, Mobility Controllers provide flexible solutions for networks of all sizes, from small offices to large-scale deployments like universities, airports, and smart cities.
