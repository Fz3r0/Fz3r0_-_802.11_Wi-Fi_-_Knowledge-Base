# `802.11h` - `DFS` & `TPC`

In 2003, the IEEE ratified the 802.11h amandement which proposed two capabilitied for Wi-Fi radios:

1. DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection)
2. TPC (Transmit Power Control)

802.11h was meant to bring two main features : `DFS` and `TPC`.

1. `DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection)`: DFS is all about **detect RADAR** pulses _(6 different type of pulses)_ and **move to other 5 GHz channel**. Based on **Spectrum** management (Layer 1) to ensures that channels containing **RADARs** are avoided by the **AP**. It is also used to reduce interference to **Satellites** <br> <br>
2. `TPC (Transmit Power Control)`: Initial 802.11h goal of TPC was to protect the EESS (Earth Exploration Satellite Services), so the TPC ensures that the average power on the 802.11 device (AP/STA) is less than the regulatory domain maximun to reduce interference to the EESS. This means that **the TPC mechanism limit the overall RF power/gain of 802.11 devices** so they don't interfere with the satellites. 
**Now it is used in ALL BANDS for other reasons such as reducing contention interference caused by client STAs.**







# 802.11h - `DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection)`

Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) is a channel allocation scheme specified for 802.11 WLANs (Wi-Fi).

DFS is all about radar `detection` and `avoidance`. It is designed to prevent electromagnetic interference by avoiding co-channel operation with systems that predated Wi-Fi, such as: 

- Military radar
- Satellite communication
- weather radar

It also to provide on aggregate a near-uniform loading of the spectrum (uniform spreading).





## DFS: `DFS Rules`

The DFS rules are just "how" to transmit in a DFS channel aswell "how" to avoid interference. The DFS rules are not just for IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) transmissions, they are made for all devices using the 5 GHz band, and each one of those devices should not interfere with a RADAR.

- `Note`: The DFS rules can change depending on each country, but for the most part are very similar. 

| **Concept**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Max/Min Time**              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **`CAC (Channel Availability Check)`** | `CAC` is a DFS function that monitors a channel to determine if a RADAR waveform above the DFS detection threshold is present. `CAC Time` is the time for which the system must monitor a channel for radar prior to any data being transmitted over the channel.                                                                                                                           | Normal DFS: _(max)_ **60 seconds**<br>Weather DFS: _(max)_ **600 seconds** |
| **`Channel Move Time`**            | The time taken by the system to vacate a channel. It's measured from the end of the radar burst to the end of the data transmission on that channel.                                                                                              | _(max)_ **10 seconds**                |
| **`NOP (Non-Occupancy Period)`**   | The period for which a radar-detected channel should not be used.                                                                                                                                                                               | _(at least)_ **30 minutes**          |
| **`NOL (Non-Occupancy List)`**     | A **list of channels** where the AP has detected radar presence within the last 30 minutes per timer.                                                                                                                                               | **Last 30 minutes**           |
| **`Channel Closing Time`**         | The time in which the AP must **cease data transmission** on the channel.                                                                                                                                                                           | **1 second**                  |
| **`In-Service Monitor`**           | AP monitors the operating channel for the presence of **ISM radar**.                                                                                                                                                                                | **Continuously**              |
| **`Master Device`**                | Any device that **can detect** RADAR (Typically an **AP**). <br> The Master Device has the ability to control other individual components in a coordination system. **DFS Certification is requiered for Master Devices**                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **AP**                        |
| **`Client Device`**                | A device that **cannot detect** RADAR  (Typically a client **STA**). <br> Instead, it relies on seeing valid data from the **Master Device‚Äôs Beacon Frame**. <br>No RADAR detection is requiered if the Client Device is controlled by Master Device  <br> **Certification requiered to prove to RF regulatory body that the client device obeys the master device.**                                                                                                                             | **STA**                       |

- Because the 2.4 GHz band is free of RADAR, **the DFS rules only apply to the `5.250 -> 5.725 GHz band (UNNI-2 / UNNI-2 extended)`**.
- An AP, when moving to a new DFS channel, has to listen silently to the medium for one minute before it is allowed to transmit anything (like a beacon) in order to make sure that  no radar is currently operating on that channel. Clients do not have such a responsibility and are allowed to send wifi frames if an AP is already present and beaconing on the channel, this leaves all the responsibility on the shoulders of the AP.
- Certain channels like 120,124 and 128 have specific rules where an AP even has to wait 10 minutes before being able to use those channels.

## DFS: `5 GHz - UNNI & DFS Channels`

The 5 GHz band is a frequency range used for wireless communication, particularly in 802.11  (Wi-Fi) networks, offering multiple channels designated as **UNII channels (Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure)** for different uses. 

Introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000s, these channels provide wider bandwidth and less interference compared to the congested 2.4 GHz band. 

- However, **certain DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) channels within the UNII-2 Extended and UNII-2 bands are subject to radar detection due to their proximity to frequencies used by weather and aviation radars.**

These channels require devices to monitor for radar signals before transmitting to avoid interference, which can disrupt radar operations and compromise safety. The regulations were established to ensure that wireless devices could coexist with these critical radar systems.

## DFS: `RADAR bands`

Military radar band nomenclature, L, S, C, X, Ku, and K bands originated during World War II as a secret code so scientists and engineers could talk about frequencies without divulging them. After the war the codes were declassified and Ka band and millimeter (mm) were added. Military radar band nomenclature is widely used today in radar, satellite and terrestrial communications, and military electronic countermeasure applications.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/514c2305-5ba2-41fc-a0fd-2a789022544b)

Military HF, VHF, UHF same as Radio Band HF, VHF, UHF respectively.

### DFS: IEEE C Band (RADAR)

The C band is a designation by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in the microwave range of frequencies ranging from 4.0 to 8.0 gigahertz (GHz).[1] However, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission C band proceeding and auction, designated 3.7‚Äì4.2 GHz as C band.[2] The C band is used for many satellite communications transmissions, some cordless telephones, as well as some radar and weather radar systems.

- `Important`: **The C band is used by 5 GHz Wi-fi networks**

The C band contains the 5.725 - 5.875 GHz ISM band allowing unlicensed use by low power devices, such as garage door openers, wireless doorbells, and baby monitors. A very large use is by the high frequency (5.2 GHz) band of Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11a) wireless computer networks. These are the most widely used computer networks in the world, used to allow laptops, smartphones, printers and TVs to connect to the internet through a wireless router in home and small office networks, and access points in hotels, libraries, and coffee shops.

## DFS: `Good Practice`:`5 GHz DFS Channels Configuration`

In most cases, it‚Äôs advisable to include DFS channels in the channel plan, as they help reduce co-channel interference (CCI) by increasing the number of available channels and minimizing overlap between APs that might otherwise interfere with each other.

However, for a more tailored setup, factors like venue type, industry verticals, device types, and surrounding RF conditions should be considered.

From experience, I avoid using weather channels (120, 124, and 128), as many client devices in high-density networks struggle to detect them, even without DFS events. While this can also happen with other DFS channels, it‚Äôs generally less common and may relate to device certification limitations. As a result, I typically exclude channels like 120, 124, and 128 to maintain consistency.

Adhering to channel bandwidth best practices is also critical. For high-density networks in the 5 GHz band, CWNP recommends using only 20 MHz channels to reduce overlap and interference. If 40 MHz channels are necessary, pay close attention to channel bonding, as it requires pairing channels strategically. For example, including channel 116 will also pull in 120, 124, and 128, so it‚Äôs important to plan around these dependencies to optimize performance.

If specific DFS channels frequently experience DFS Events, it‚Äôs best to remove them from the plan to maintain network reliability.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eeabed0-02b9-43c0-8099-d7268012f259)

**`Important`**: Most current-day client devices are being certified to transmit on the DFS channels, and the inclusion of DFS channels in channel reuse patterns is becoming more commonplace. **There are still 802.11 devices out in the wild that cant't "hear" DFS channels tho!!!**

## DFS: `Radars`

**Radar stands for **RAdio Detection And Ranging**. In the past, the Radars used to operate in frequency ranges where they were the only type of device operating there. **Now that regulatory agencies are opening those frequencies for other uses (like wireless LAN), there is a need for those devices to operate in accordance of the radars.** _(802.11a->DFS)_

There are 2 main types of Radars:

1. `Fixed`: Often **civilian airport** or **military base**, but also **weather radars**
2. `Mobile`: Ships 

Example Doppler Weather RADARs:

### RADARs: RADAR Operation

The radar transmits a focused pulse of microwave energy (like a microwave oven or a cell phone, but stronger) at an object, most likely a cloud. Part of this beam of energy bounces back and is measured by the radar, providing information about the object. Radar can measure precipitation size, quantity, speed and direction of movement, within about 100 mile radius of its location.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fz3r0/Fz3r0_-_802.11_Wi-Fi_-_Knowledge-Base/refs/heads/main/Images/doppler%20radar.gif)

Doppler radar is a specific type of radar that uses the Doppler effect to gather velocity data from the particles that are being measured. For example, a Doppler radar transmits a signal that gets reflected off raindrops within a storm. The reflected radar signal is measured by the radar's receiver with a change in frequency. That frequency shift is directly related to the motion of the raindrops.

- `Distance to the location of the rain`: Calculated from the travel time of the electromagnetic wave from the transmitter until it returns to the sensor.
- `precipitation intensity`: Calculated from the amplitude of the reflected wave (the strength of echo)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fd7c25d-d0a9-4b02-b9fb-9b56294413ab)

**Radar typical operation:**

1. Radar measures the distance to the target from the time of arrival of the scattered pulse.
2. When it receives a signal from a device sending a continuous wave (CW), such as telecommunication links, we see a line oriented radially toward the center of the radar image.
3. If the interfering transmitter is near the radar, we see the disturbance in a sector that can be as much as several tens of degrees wide _(eg. Wi-Fi lines or real weather lines in the last pictures)_.


### Radars: `Weather Signature` VS `Doppler Radar + Wi-Fi Interference`

The next screenshoot is from a typical weather Doppler Radar signature, it could be rain, snow etc. Meteorological Institutions are using these RADARs to detect atmospheric events in an area. So, for the below image, we can see some rain. This is a regular output for a rainy day(s):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3876ccc-8c33-4937-90e3-7accda0479c9)

However, RADARs are using very very high gain antennas and they can pick up your very weak WiFi transmission. So, if not DFS rules are used, literally "blinds" the RADAR and it cannot see the atmosphere, it cannot work as expected.

In the next picture some "unnatural straight lines" are seen, that's 802.11 Wi-Fi signal without using DFS rules and "blinding" the RADAR:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/637bc590-dfb7-49a2-9e69-e0197408a419)

**General Radar Operation**

1. A Radar-STA will transmit a set of powerful pulses periodically and observe the reflections.
2. Because the energy reflected back to the radar is much weaker than the original signal, the radar has to transmit a very powerful signal.
3. Also, because the energy reflected back to the radar is very weak, it could confuse it with other radio signals (like a wireless LAN to give an example).

**The general behavior of a device complying with the DFS protocol is:**

1. Being able to **detect** when a radar is occupying the channel
2. **Stop using that occupied channel**.
3. **Monitor** another channel
4. **jump** on it if it is ok. (eg. no radar there as well).

`Important`: The **process for a radio to detect a radar** is a complicated task that **is actually not part of the standard**. Hence, wrong radar detections can occur.

`Note`: _DFS is required for ETSI devices working in the European Union in the ETSI 5ghz band. It can be not mandatory in other parts of the world._

### DFS: `Detection Threshold`

- `Detection Threshold`: The minimum signal level that must be present before the system triggered to move to another channel. Interference detection threshold is calculated based on a 0 dBi antenna. 

**FCC Detection Threshold** _(FCC is only for USA but regulations in Europe are very similar)_:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92cc2d23-0bb9-44b5-b6eb-1d9a703bae7a)

### DFS: `Pulse Radar Waveforms`

- **Pulse Radar Waveforms** are distinct **RADAR signal patterns that DFS mechanisms must detect to avoid interference.** 

These waveforms, characterized by various pulse types (fixed, short, long, and frequency-hopping), are emitted by RADAR systems operating in the same frequency bands as certain Wi-Fi channels. The DFS feature continuously scans for these radar pulses and, when detected, automatically switches the Wi-Fi network to a different channel to prevent disruption.

- 7 RADAR waveforms types are tested for DFS certification
- Short Pulses = 5
- Long Pulses = 1
- Frequency Hopping = 1

The table below outlines each radar pulse type and describes the unique requirements of DFS to manage interference for reliable Wi-Fi operation:

| **Pulse Type**        | **Radar Type**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fixed Pulse**       | Type 0                 | Fixed, consistent radar signal with no variability. It serves as a baseline for detecting simple radar patterns due to its steady nature.      |
| **Short Pulse**       | Type 1                 | Variable short pulses with different timing patterns, used to simulate quick radar signals. DFS must detect and respond to rapid changes.       |
| **Short Pulse**       | Type 2                 | More complex short pulses with a variety of frequencies and timings. DFS handles these patterns by recognizing broader ranges of pulse changes. |
| **Short Pulse**       | Type 3                 | Short pulses with high variability, designed to be harder to detect. DFS requires quick adaptation to manage these irregular signals.           |
| **Short Pulse**       | Type 4                 | High-interference potential short pulses. DFS must rapidly detect these pulses to switch channels and minimize Wi-Fi disruption.               |
| **Long Pulse**        | Type 5                 | Long pulses that cover extended time intervals. DFS needs to detect these to avoid prolonged radar interference, requiring faster response.     |
| **Frequency Hopping** | Type 6 (20M, 40M, 80M, 160M) | Radar signals that quickly jump across different frequencies. DFS must track these shifts across various bandwidths to prevent Wi-Fi disruption.|

## DFS: Frame Exchange

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26ab851f-c4e1-48eb-8deb-d3ef4e17d06e" width="300" height="300">

DFS operations use different ways of exchanging information between STAs. Information can be put in specific elements: 

1. Beacon
2. Probe Response
3. Action Frame (specific frame can also be used to report information) 








## DFS: Radar detection mechanism

When AP starts operation:

1. The AP automatically selects channels with low interference levels in a phase known as `Channel Availability Check (CAC)`.
2. During this phase, the access point is in a passive state scanning for radar signals _(This commonly takes one to two minutes, but could take up to ten minutes)_.
3. hereafter, the access point performs In-Service Monitoring (ISM) to detect active radar signals

If radar is detected by the AP:

1. AP broadcasts a `Action Frame: switch-channel event` to its clients and follows by switching the channel.
1. When the radio detects a radar, it must **stop using the channel** for **30 minutes at least** to protect that service.
2. It then **monitors another channel**
3. AP **start using that channel** **after at least 1 minute if no radar was detected**.



## Examples: 


















# TPC (Transmit Power Control) 

Initial 802.11h goal of TPC was to protect the **EESS (Earth Exploration Satellite Services)**, so the TPC ensures that the average power on the 802.11 device (AP/STA) is less than the regulatory domain maximun to reduce interference to the EESS. 

This means that:

- **The TPC mechanism limit the overall RF power/gain of 802.11 devices**, so they don't interfere with the EESS. 

But, the mechanism of power reduction it can be used for **other purposes**:

- **Nowdays TPC is used in ALL BANDS _(eg. 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz band)_ for reducing contention interference caused by client STAs. Client STAs that also support TPC can adjust their power to match AP transmit power. Mostly used for outdoor comunications.**

### TPC: `Legacy TPC`:`EESS (Earth Exploration Satellite Services)`

**Earth Exploration Satellite Systems (EESS)** are satellite services designed to monitor and study phenomena affecting Earth‚Äôs environment, including the atmosphere, land, and oceans. 

They use active and passive spaceborne sensors to collect data; active sensors emit signals and measure their reflection, while passive sensors capture natural emissions. 

Operating across frequencies from **432 MHz to 238 GHz**, EESS applications span climate monitoring, weather forecasting, agriculture, oceanography, disaster management, and environmental protection. 

Despite challenges like data transmission and interference, advancements include improved spatial resolution and machine learning for data analysis.

- `Important`: 802.11h TPC was designed to prevent interference with EESS satellite systems, especially in the 5 GHz band, which EESS and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) can share. TPC helps adjust 802.11 devices' transmit power to minimize interference, protecting EESS operations. **However, today, TPC is primarily used to manage power efficiency and optimize network performance rather than for interference protection with satellite systems.** 

### TPC: `Modern TPC`:`Network Management`

Nowdays TPC is used in ALL BANDS _(eg. 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz band)_ for reducing contention interference caused by client STAs _(CCI caused by the client STA themself)_. Mostly used for outdoor comunications.

- Client STAs that also support TPC can adjust their power to match AP transmit power. 

**`Important`**: Sometimes **TPC can cause problems in some legacy devices** which don't support TPC
