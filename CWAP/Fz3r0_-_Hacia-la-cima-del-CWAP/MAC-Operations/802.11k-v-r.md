# MAC Operations: `802.11k/v/r` - `Roaming` , `Neighbor Report` , `Band Balance` , `Load Balance`




- `802.11k`:  Informs client STAs of the WLAN RF information such as the AP **Channel** and **RSSI**. **Neighbor Report Requests** & **Neighbor Report Responses** exchange this info between STAs. 
This allows clients to make more informed roaming decisions. Ultimately, **client STAs still make the final roaming decision.** 

- `802.11v`: allows the **AP to suggest roaming decisions to clients**. These decisions are based on **load of total clients** as well as **channel conditions** supplied with **`802.11k` neighbor reports**.

This means: 

- **802.22k informs clients for roaming decisions whereas 802.11v manages roams based on AP determination (using information from 802.11k).**

As a result, using 802.11v is more likely to disrupt network access if the behavior isn't understood with the clients you're supporting.

Wi-Fi Technology uses different roaming protocols to assist roaming. Below is an attempt to explain the topic in an easy-to-understand way.
Imagine a conversation between your wireless mobile device and your Wi-Fi access point/router while roaming!

802.11k:

Wireless Mobile: Hello Mr. Access Point, I'm too far away from you, and I want to move to another access point.

Access Point: Please go ahead, no one's stopping you 😒.

Wireless Mobile: But I'm too lazy to scan all the channels 😕. Can you give me a neighbor report of all the nearby APs?

Access Point : You want to leave me and still ask for help with scanning? Well, I'm a nice guy, and I do support 11k. Send me a formal 11k request, and I'll share the report.

Wireless Mobile: Here’s an action frame requesting the neighbor report 😊.

Access Point: Cool, here are the APs you can choose to roam to. The decision is yours.

Wireless Mobile: You’re so kind. Thank you, bye 👋🏻.

802.11k assists clients in identifying nearby access points (APs), minimizing the need for off-channel scanning during the decision-making process of which AP to roam to next. When necessary, the client can request a neighbor report that provides a list of nearby APs.


802.11v:

Imagine a wireless mobile device having trouble sending or receiving data because it's too far from the access point (AP).

Access Point: Hello there, my dear mobile device. Why are you struggling here instead of moving to another AP?

Wireless Mobile: I'm just being loyal 😅.

Access Point: Well, keep your loyalty in your pocket. Here’s the best AP nearby for you to connect to. Go and connect, no need to struggle here.

Wireless Mobile: Hehe, thanks! Bye 👋🏻.

802.11v BSS Transition Management enables an access point (AP) to recommend or request that a device switch to a different AP, often to balance the network load or if the current AP can no longer maintain the connection. This helps the device choose the best AP from a list of suggested options. In networks where APs can talk to each other, this process becomes more dependable. APs track the device's signal strength (RSSI) using Probe requests to ensure a strong connection.

802.11r:

Access Point: So, you've finally decided to move on 💔.

Wireless Mobile: Yeah, but I need to authenticate with the RADIUS server again, and that takes so much time 🥲.

Access Point: Don’t worry, I can do you a last favor so you can skip the authentication and connect to another AP in under 50ms.

Wireless Mobile: That’s so sweet of you! But how can we do that?

Access Point: Just tell the neighboring AP that you’re my client and share the PMKID. Then, use PMKR1 to generate the PTK.Remember, these are secret codes which will help authenticate!

Wireless Mobile: Cool, thanks for the tip. I’ll miss you though 😕💔.

802.11r speeds up client roaming between APs by allowing clients to skip reauthentication with the RADIUS server. The secret keys can be exchanged over air/backend.






##  802.11k/r Information Elements








Immediately my smugness shot to Maximum because this is something I’m very familiar with, you might even have seen my WLPC EU 2019 video analysing 802.11k/r/v. However, as the biotic hamsters in my dusty shell of a skull scurried around trying to find the grey matter holding this information my smugness waned.

When Vince finally put me out of my misery the IE names did not ring a bell with me. Not a single one! So the only reasonable course of action was to blog about it, to cement it into the aforementioned grey matter, and hopefully help someone else out too.

Now, if you’ve ever poked around the 802.11 standard document or got into 802.11 analysis you’ve no doubt noticed the convolution around naming conventions. One of the easiest examples of this is the PHY naming conventions – we all refer to it as 11ac but it is officially referred to as ‘Very High Throughput’ (VHT) in the 802.11 standard document. I won’t go into why that is, if you want to know just tweet or email me.

As a side note, if you were one of those people who thought to yourself “or Wi-Fi 5 now, muhahah” when reading the above then congratulations, people hate you. You know who you are.

Side side note, I have nothing against the new WFA brand names for Wi-Fi, I actually think it is helpful from a consumer point of view.

ANYWAY, enough ramblings! Why did I bring up the naming conventions? Because 802.11k/r are no different, and this can cause confusion when looking for them in a packet capture.

802.11k
The working group was called ‘802.11k’, and last time I checked in both Cisco and Aruba you will find this feature listed by this name. However, the feature is actually known as ‘Radio Resource Measurement‘ and “Radio Measurement” within the 802.11 standard itself (which makes things even more confusing because of the common industry term ‘Radio Resource Management’ which has nothing to do with it).

This is important because when we look at a Beacon frame we are looking for an Information Element named “RM Enabled Capability“. What do ya think the “RM” part of that stands for…? Radio Measurement.

If there is no RM Enabled Capability IE (Information Element) then 802.11k is NOT enabled on that SSID. If it is there then I think you can safely assume 802.11k is supported, but more specifically you can check to see if Neighbor Reports is Enabled under the first RM Capabilities octet.

Here is what it looks like in Wireshark

Here is what it looks like in Omnipeek (click to expand)

802.11r
What about 802.11r? Do we have the same naming confusing? Of course we do!!!

Again, the working group was 802.11r but the feature is known as ‘Fast BSS Transition’ or ‘Fast Transition‘. Cisco refer to it as ‘Fast Transition’ and Aruba refers to is as ‘802.11r’.

So what about the beacon information element? Consistent? Similar? Nope!

The beacon IE itself is called “Mobility Domain“. Easily confused with the very similar exactly same language used for a completely unrelated function within Cisco (to be clear, Cisco used the term before 802.11 did I believe). Once you dig into the Mobility Domain IE you will then see the terms ‘FT’ and ‘Fast BSS Transition’ being used.

If you do not see the Mobility Domain IE then the SSID does NOT support 802.11r. If it does exist, then you need to expand out the ‘FT Capability and Policy’ sub-element to identify whether the SSID is using ‘FT Over the Air’ or ‘FT Over the DS’. But you won’t find two separate settings, this is a binary decision, one or the other must be used. Therefore the parameter ‘Fast BSS Transition over DS’ is used to indicate which it is; Enabled obviously means that Over the DS is used, and disabled can be surmised as Over The Air is used.

Here is what it looks like within Wireshark, including the sub-element identifying that the SSID uses FT ‘Over The DS’.


Here is what it looks like within Wireshark, including the sub-element identifying that the SSID uses FT ‘Over The Air’ (because Over The DS is disabled).


Here is what it looks like within Omnipeek, including the sub-element identifying that the SSID uses FT ‘Over The DS’.


Here is what it looks like within Wireshark, including the sub-element identifying that the SSID uses FT ‘Over The Air’.


Hope that helps someone. As always, any comments welcome. And if you spot anything I’ve got wrong please let me know!
