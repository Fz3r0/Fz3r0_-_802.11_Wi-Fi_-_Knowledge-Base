# MAC Operations: `802.11k/v/r` - `Roaming` , `Neighbor Report` , `Band Balance` , `Load Balance`




- `802.11k`:  Informs client STAs of the WLAN RF information such as the AP **Channel** and **RSSI**. **Neighbor Report Requests** & **Neighbor Report Responses** exchange this info between STAs. 
This allows clients to make more informed roaming decisions. Ultimately, **client STAs still make the final roaming decision.** 

- `802.11v`: allows the **AP to suggest roaming decisions to clients**. These decisions are based on **load of total clients** as well as **channel conditions** supplied with **`802.11k` neighbor reports**.

As a result, using 802.11v is more likely to disrupt network access if the behavior isn't understood with the clients you're supporting.


# RRM: 802.11k - RRM (Radio Resource Measurement)

- Neihbor Reports inform clients of BSSID RF Conditions
- Clients ask for specific SSID info in requests
- Responses tell clients the AP channel for RF conditions

## RRM: Frame exchange

Beacons

- `RM Enables Capabilites`

Filter

- `wlan.fixed.action_code in {0x04,0x05}`
