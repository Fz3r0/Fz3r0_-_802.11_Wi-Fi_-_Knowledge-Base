# MAC Operations: `802.11k/v/r` - `Roaming` , `Neighbor Report` , `Band Balance` , `Load Balance`




- `802.11k`:  Informs client STAs of the WLAN RF information such as the AP **Channel** and **RSSI**. **Neighbor Report Requests** & **Neighbor Report Responses** exchange this info between STAs. 
This allows clients to make more informed roaming decisions. Ultimately, **client STAs still make the final roaming decision.** 

- `802.11v`: allows the **AP to suggest roaming decisions to clients**. These decisions are based on **load of total clients** as well as **channel conditions** supplied with **`802.11k` neighbor reports**.

This means: 

- **802.22k informs clients for roaming decisions whereas 802.11v manages roams based on AP determination (using information from 802.11k).**

As a result, using 802.11v is more likely to disrupt network access if the behavior isn't understood with the clients you're supporting.


# RRM: 802.11k - RRM (Radio Resource Measurement)

- Neihbor Reports inform clients of BSSID RF Conditions
- Clients ask for specific SSID info in requests
- Responses tell clients the AP channel for RF conditions

## RRM: Frame exchange

Beacons

- `RM Enables Capabilites`

- `wlan.fixed.action_code in {0x04,0x05}`













# WNM: 802.11v - WNM (Wireless Network Management)

- Includes a few amandfments, but known as BSS Transition Management
- BSS Transition Management Request & Responses manage sTAs between BSSIDs
- Incorporates 802.11k neoighbor reports.

Wi-Fi Technology uses different roaming protocols to assist roaming. Below is an attempt to explain the topic in an easy-to-understand way.
Imagine a conversation between your wireless mobile device and your Wi-Fi access point/router while roaming!

802.11k:

Wireless Mobile: Hello Mr. Access Point, I'm too far away from you, and I want to move to another access point.

Access Point: Please go ahead, no one's stopping you 😒.

Wireless Mobile: But I'm too lazy to scan all the channels 😕. Can you give me a neighbor report of all the nearby APs?

Access Point : You want to leave me and still ask for help with scanning? Well, I'm a nice guy, and I do support 11k. Send me a formal 11k request, and I'll share the report.

Wireless Mobile: Here’s an action frame requesting the neighbor report 😊.

Access Point: Cool, here are the APs you can choose to roam to. The decision is yours.

Wireless Mobile: You’re so kind. Thank you, bye 👋🏻.

802.11k assists clients in identifying nearby access points (APs), minimizing the need for off-channel scanning during the decision-making process of which AP to roam to next. When necessary, the client can request a neighbor report that provides a list of nearby APs.


802.11v:

Imagine a wireless mobile device having trouble sending or receiving data because it's too far from the access point (AP).

Access Point: Hello there, my dear mobile device. Why are you struggling here instead of moving to another AP?

Wireless Mobile: I'm just being loyal 😅.

Access Point: Well, keep your loyalty in your pocket. Here’s the best AP nearby for you to connect to. Go and connect, no need to struggle here.

Wireless Mobile: Hehe, thanks! Bye 👋🏻.

802.11v BSS Transition Management enables an access point (AP) to recommend or request that a device switch to a different AP, often to balance the network load or if the current AP can no longer maintain the connection. This helps the device choose the best AP from a list of suggested options. In networks where APs can talk to each other, this process becomes more dependable. APs track the device's signal strength (RSSI) using Probe requests to ensure a strong connection.

802.11r:

Access Point: So, you've finally decided to move on 💔.

Wireless Mobile: Yeah, but I need to authenticate with the RADIUS server again, and that takes so much time 🥲.

Access Point: Don’t worry, I can do you a last favor so you can skip the authentication and connect to another AP in under 50ms.

Wireless Mobile: That’s so sweet of you! But how can we do that?

Access Point: Just tell the neighboring AP that you’re my client and share the PMKID. Then, use PMKR1 to generate the PTK.Remember, these are secret codes which will help authenticate!

Wireless Mobile: Cool, thanks for the tip. I’ll miss you though 😕💔.

802.11r speeds up client roaming between APs by allowing clients to skip reauthentication with the RADIUS server. The secret keys can be exchanged over air/backend.
