### Reverse Direction (RD) Protocol

Before the RD protocol, each uni-directional data transfer required the initiating station to capture (and possibly reserve time on) a contention-based RF medium.  With RD, once the transmitting station has obtained a TXOP, it may essentially grant permission to the other station to send information back during its TXOP.

- **Upon receipt of a reverse direction grant (RDG), the receiving station may Transmit data back to the source of the RDG within the current TXOP**
