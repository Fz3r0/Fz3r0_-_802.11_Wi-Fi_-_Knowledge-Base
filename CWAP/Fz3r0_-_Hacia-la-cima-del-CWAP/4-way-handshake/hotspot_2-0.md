# Hotspot 2.0 (Passpoint)

- Hotspot 2.0 (also known as PasspointÂ®, the trademarked name of the Wi-Fi Alliance solution) aims to improve the experience of mobile users when selecting and joining a Wi-Fi hotspot by providing information to the station prior to association.
- Hotspot 2.0 can be leveraged to set up a guest hotspot service, offering public access to users through its Wi-Fi networks. It streamlines the process of accessing Wi-Fi networks by a variety of devices that have Wi-Fi capabilities, such as APs, smartphones, and so on.
- Hotspot 2.0 networks are created by Wi-Fi operators and identity providers.
- A Wi-Fi operator deploys and operates an access network of publicly accessible or guest access APs.
- An Identity Provider provides network services and operates the AAA infrastructure required to authenticate subscribers.
- The Wi-Fi Operator and Identity Provider may be the same or different entities.
- The Service Providers (SPs) that can be accessed at a hotspot are referred to as the roaming partners for that hotspot.
- The Identity Provider performing the authentication can provide its subscribers with AAA connectivity to its network through the hotspot.
- Identity Providers are advertised using 3GPP cellular network information, an NAI realm list, or a roaming consortium list.
- There can be one or more identity providers per Hotspot 2.0 access network.

Hotspot 2.0 networks offer accessibility and mobility, enabling internet access in public areas with secure authentication and roaming capabilities, ensuring safe access and connectivity.

## Hotspot 2.0 benefits:

- Automates the connection experience at hotspots, providing a secure encrypted airlink for public Wi-Fi networks
- Supports multiple roaming partners over a single SSID
