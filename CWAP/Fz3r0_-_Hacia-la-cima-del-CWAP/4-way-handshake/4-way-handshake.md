# 4-Way-Handshake

- The 4-way handshake is the process of exchanging 4 messages between an access point (authenticator) and the client device (supplicant) to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over Wireless medium.
- Occurs after the client STA is authenticated and associated. _(this means, after the State 3 of the State Machine = State 3: Associated)_
- Is used to generate the keys used to encrypt various types of traffic (Unicast, Multicast, Broadcat) between **AP** and **client STA**.
- Utilizes an **exchange of 4 EAPOL Key Frames also known as "Messages"** between the client STA and the AP (`M1`, `M2`, `M3`, `M4`).
- In a PSK Network (eg. WPA2), the exchange of frames occurs after the open system authentication and association _(just after the State 3 of the State Machine)_
- In a 802.1X Network (eg. EAP/RADIUS), the 4-way-handshake occurs after EAP authentication _(after the State 3 of the State Machine + EAP Exchange between AP & Authentication Server)_
- Through the 4-way-handshake procedure, several keys are generated sequentially

# üóùÔ∏èüè≠‚òÅÔ∏è MSK (Master Session Key) [AAA Key]

- The first level key is generated is MSK during the process of 802.1X/EAP or PSK authentication.

- MSK information is jointly negotiated between the Supplicant & Authentication Server. This key information is transported via a secure channel from Authenticating Server to Authenticator.
- The MSK serves as the foundation for deriving the PMK (Pairwise Master Key), which is then used in subsequent 4-way handshake processes to derive encryption keys like the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) and GTK (Group Temporal Key).
- The MSK is never transmitted over the network but is shared between the Supplicant (STA) and the Authentication Server (eg. RADIUS), which is securely transported to the Authenticator (AP) for further use.

## üè≠üí° MSK Summary

- MSK Size: 512 bits (64 bytes).
- Generation Method: EAP method (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP).
- Used For: Deriving the PMK, which then derives the PTK and GTK for encryption and secure data transmission.
- Created by Supplicant (STA) and the Authentication Server independently, they should match with each other.
- Not transmitted: the MSK is never transmitted directly over the network.

### üè≠üî¢ Example of MSK:

- `MSK Hexadecimal Format`: When displayed or logged, the MSK is typically shown in hexadecimal format :: 256 bits (32 bytes):

````sh
# MSK
1A 2B 3C 4D 5E 6F 7A 8B 9C AD BE CF D0 E1 F2 03
14 25 36 47 58 69 7A 8B 9C AD BE CF D1 E2 F3 04
15 26 37 48 59 6A 7B 8C 9D AE BF C0 D1 E2 F3 14
25 36 47 58 69 7A 8B 9C AD BE CF D1 E2 F3 04 15
````

- The `PMK (Pairwise Master Key)` is derived from the MSK (Master Session Key) by taking the first 256 bits (32 bytes) of the MSK:

````sh
# PMK derived from MSK (first 256 bits (32 bytes) of the MSK)
1A 2B 3C 4D 5E 6F 7A 8B 9C AD BE CF D0 E1 F2 03
14 25 36 47 58 69 7A 8B 9C AD BE CF D1 E2 F3 04
````

## üè≠üßÆ MSK Derivation

MSK derivation happens during the EAP authentication process. The exact method varies depending on the EAP method used:

### ‚≠ï EAP-TLS:

In EAP-TLS, the MSK is derived as part of the TLS handshake between the Supplicant and the Authentication Server, using the session key negotiated during the TLS handshake.

### ‚≠ï EAP-PEAP:

In EAP-PEAP, a secure tunnel is created using TLS, within which another authentication method (e.g., MSCHAPv2) is used. The result of this process is the MSK.

## MSK Transport:

- After MSK is derived between the Supplicant and Authentication Server, it is securely transferred to the Authenticator (AP) via RADIUS or another secure protocol.
- The Authenticator (AP) then uses this MSK to derive the PMK.

## MSK to PMK Conversion Formula:

The PMK is derived from the MSK. The first 256 bits (32 bytes) of the MSK are used as the PMK.

- **`PMK = MSK[:32]`**  _(First 32 bytes of the MSK are the PMK)_

## MSK derivation simulation: Python

NOTE: This is NOT a real-life MSK derivation process!!!

- In real 802.1X/EAP, MSK is derived during the EAP authentication process, not through PBKDF2.

# üóùÔ∏èüü∞ü§ù PMK (Pairwise Master Key)

- The PMK serves as the foundation for deriving further encryption keys, such as the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) and GTK (Group Temporal Key), which are used for securing individual and group communications in a Wi-Fi network.
- The PMK is never transmitted over the network; instead, it is independently derived by both the Access Point (AP) and the Station (STA) using the same method.
- For secure communication, the PMK generated by both parties must match, ensuring successful authentication and enabling secure data transmission.
- Both parties (AP & STA), uses the same formula to derive the PMK (that's why the PMK must match)

## üü∞üí° PMK Summary

- PMK Size: 256 bits (32 bytes).
- Derivation Method: PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1 (WPA2-Personal) // Derived from the MSK (802.1X-Enterprise) // SAE Handshake (WPA3-Personal).
- Created by Authenticator (AP) & Supplicant (STA) independently, they should match with each other.
- Not transmitted: the PMK is never transmitted directly over the network.

## üü∞üßÆ PMK Derivation

PMK derivation refers to the process of generating the PMK from a shared secret (like a pre-shared key) or from an authentication method (like EAP in 802.1X).

### ‚≠ï WPA2-Personal (PSK): 

The PMK is derived from a Pre-Shared Key (PSK), typically using a process like PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1 to transform the passphrase and SSID into a secure key.

### ‚≠ï WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X): 

The PMK is derived from the Master Session Key (MSK), which is generated during the EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) authentication process. The PMK in this case is the first 256 bits of the MSK.

### ‚≠ï WPA3-Personal: 

The PMK is derived from the SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) handshake, which is based on elliptic-curve cryptography and does not directly use the password.

## üü∞ PMK: `WPA2-Personal (PSK)`

- In WPA2-Personal, The PMK is derived using the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm, often with HMAC-SHA1.
- The function is applied multiple times (e.g., 4096 iterations) to make brute-force attacks more difficult.

### ‚≠ï PBKDF2 PMK Inputs:

- `Passphrase (WPA)`: User's WPA2 passphrase
- `Salt`: Network SSID.
- `Iterations`: 4096 rounds of HMAC-SHA1.
- `Output`: 256-bit PMK used for subsequent key derivations (like PTK and GTK) in the WPA2 authentication process.

### ‚≠ï PBKDF2 derivation formula

- **`PMK = PBKDF2(HMAC-SHA1, PSK, SSID(salt), rounds=4096, dklen=32)`**

### üêç PMK derivation using PBKDF2: `Python`

## PMK using 802.1X-EAP (Enterprise)

- In WPA2-Enterprise (802.1X), the PMK is derived from the MSK generated during the EAP process, so PBKDF2 is not used.

## PMK using WPA3

- One of the key differences between WPA2 and WPA3 is how the PMK (Pairwise Master Key) is derived, particularly in WPA3-Personal.
- In WPA2-Personal, the PMK is derived from a pre-shared key (PSK), while in WPA3-Personal, the PSK mechanism is replaced by SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals).
- SAE is a password-based key exchange protocol that uses elliptic-curve cryptography (Dragonfly handshake) to derive the PMK, without transmitting or directly using the password.
- After the SAE handshake establishes the PMK, WPA3 still uses a 4-way handshake, much like WPA2, to derive other keys like the PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) and the GTK (Group Temporal Key).









# GTK

## Anonce & Snonce

- These nonces are random 256-bit (32-byte) values generated during the 4-way handshake process to provide freshness and prevent replay attacks. 
- The ANonce (Authenticator Nonce) is a `256-bit (32-byte)` random value generated by the **Access Point (AP)** during the 4-way handshake process.
- The SNonce (Supplicant Nonce) is a `256-bit (32 bytes)` random value generated by the Supplicant (client STA) during the 4-Way Handshake process.
- They are unique per session and are essential for deriving the session keys securely.
- They play a critical role in the derivation of the **Pairwise Transient Key (PTK)**.
- They allow to both the AP (Authenticator) and the STA (Supplicant) to **independently calculate the same PTK.**

### Anonce example
