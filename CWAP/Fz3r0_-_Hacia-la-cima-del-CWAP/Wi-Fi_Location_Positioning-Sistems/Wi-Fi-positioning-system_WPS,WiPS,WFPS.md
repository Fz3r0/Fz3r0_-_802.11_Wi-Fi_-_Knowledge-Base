Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS, WiPS or WFPS) is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi‑Fi access points to discover where a device is located.

The most common technique for positioning using wireless access points is based on a rough proxy for the strength of the received signal (received signal strength indicator, or RSSI) and the method of "fingerprinting".

Accurate indoor localization is becoming more important for Wi‑Fi–based devices due to the increased use of augmented reality, social networking, health care monitoring, personal tracking, inventory control and other indoor location-aware applications.

The problem of Wi‑Fi–based indoor localization of a device is that of determining the position of client devices with respect to access points. Many techniques exist to accomplish this, and these may be classified based on the four different criteria they use: 

1. Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) [RSSI Multilateration]
2. Fingerprinting [RSSI Fingerprinting]
3. Angle of Arrival (AoA)
4. Time of Flight (ToF)

The most commonly used Wi-Fi positioning techniques determine location by using a measure called received signal strength indicator (RSSI), primarily for device multilateration or fingerprinting calculations. These signal strength-based approaches are easy to implement and cost-effective, but don't achieve high degrees of accuracy since signal strength can be influenced by the surrounding environment. RSSI solutions are also susceptible to errors introduced by objects moving within the environment, particularly people. The addition of other less common, more cutting-edge techniques can lead to more accurate Wi-Fi positioning results including Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Flight (ToF).

## Methods

### Wi-Fi Positioning Using Access Points

Wi-Fi positioning with access points relies on the existing Wi-Fi infrastructures installed throughout indoor spaces to locate devices. This allows organizations to leverage their existing infrastructure to enable location-aware applications, with no additional hardware required. Building APs can detect transmissions from surrounding Wi-Fi devices, both on and off network. This location data is then sent to a server and central IPS and used to calculate a device’s position.

### Wi-Fi Positioning Using Sensors

Wi-Fi positioning with sensors utilizes Wi-Fi-enabled sensors that are deployed in fixed positions throughout an indoor space. These sensors passively detect and locate transmissions from smartphones, asset tracking tags, beacons, personnel badges, wearables and other Wi-Fi devices. The location data collected by the sensor is then sent to a server and ingested by the central indoor positioning system (IPS) or real-time location system (RTLS). The location engine analyzes the data to determine the location of the transmitting device. Those coordinates can be used to visualize the location of a device or asset on an indoor map of your space or leveraged for other uses depending on the specific location-aware application.
