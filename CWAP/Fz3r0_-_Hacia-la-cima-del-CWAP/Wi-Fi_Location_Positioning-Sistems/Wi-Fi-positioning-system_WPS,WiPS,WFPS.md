Wi-Fi positioning system (WPS, WiPS or WFPS) is a geolocation system that uses the characteristics of nearby Wi‑Fi access points to discover where a device is located.

The most common technique for positioning using wireless access points is based on a rough proxy for the strength of the received signal (received signal strength indicator, or RSSI) and the method of "fingerprinting".

Accurate indoor localization is becoming more important for Wi‑Fi–based devices due to the increased use of augmented reality, social networking, health care monitoring, personal tracking, inventory control and other indoor location-aware applications.

The problem of Wi‑Fi–based indoor localization of a device is that of determining the position of client devices with respect to access points. Many techniques exist to accomplish this, and these may be classified based on the four different criteria they use: 

1. Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI)
2. Fingerprinting
3. Angle of Arrival (AoA)
4. Time of Flight (ToF)
